On the same day, Alibaba announced in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that the conversion of the company's voluntary secondary listing status on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to the primary listing status took effect on the same day, and the company is now a dual primary listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Pu\nThe Alibaba office building in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China, on Aug. 28, 2024.\nCFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images\nAlibaba\n posted a better-than-expected bottom line in the June quarter fueled by accelerated sales at its cloud computing unit and a continued revival of its e-commerce business.\n\nStill, the Chinese giant’s revenues came in under analyst forecasts.\n\nAlibaba’s stock was up more than 6% in premarket trading in the U.S. after initially dipping.\n\nHere’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal first quarter ended June, compared with LSEG estimates:\n\nRevenue: 247.65 billion Chinese yuan ($34.6 billion), versus 252.9 billion yuan expected.\nNet income: 43.11 billion yuan, compared with 28.5 billion yuan expected.\nRevenue rose 2% year-on-year, while the company’s net income was up 78%. Alibaba attributed the increase in profit to gains in some of its equity investments and the disposal of Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol. This was offset by a decrease in income from operations.\n\nHowever, excluding investment gains, Alibaba’s net income would have decreased 18% year-on-year as it continues to invest in the cut-throat instant commerce space in China.\n\nAlibaba is carrying out a delicate balancing act between investing areas such as artificial intelligence and new e-commerce models, while showing that it can continue to grow in China’s competitive market. So far, investors have rewarded Alibaba with a 40% rally in its U.S.-listed stock this year.\n\nThat’s partly thanks a continued growth acceleration at its key cloud computing division as well as improvements at both its China and international e-commerce businesses.\n\nCloud accelerates\nCloud computing was one of the bright spots.\n\nAlibaba said revenue at the division totaled 33.4 billion yuan, up 26% year-on-year. That was faster than the 18% growth rate seen in the previous quarter. Alibaba’s cloud unit is seen as key to the company monetizing artificial intelligence, much like Microsoft or Google.\n\n“Driven by robust AI demand, Cloud Intelligence Group experienced accelerated revenue growth, and AI-related product revenue is now a significant portion of revenue from external customers,” Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said in a statement.\n\nInvestors are focused on Alibaba’s investments in artificial intelligence, where it has become a major global player. The company has aggressively launched various AI models and is selling services through its cloud computing division.\n\nWhile Alibaba has focused open source AI — meaning its models can be used for free and built on by developers — it also sells AI services through its cloud unit.\n\nAlibaba said AI-related product revenue “maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.”\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA), a measure of profitability, jumped 26% year-on-year in the cloud unit.\n\nAlibaba management said on Friday that the aim for the company is to keep the cloud growth rate above the market average, rather than to raise gross margins in the near term.\n\n‘Quick commerce’ wars\nAlibaba’s core e-commerce business, which accounts for more than 50% of revenue, had mixed results.\n\nOverall, revenue rose 10% year-on-year to 19.6 billion yuan. Customer management revenue, which Alibaba makes off of selling marketing and other services to merchants on its platform, jumped 10%. CMR accounts for the bulk of e-commerce revenue.\n\nHowever, adjusted earnings in the division fell 21% in the quarter on an annual basis. That’s because Alibaba has been investing heavily in so-called quick or instant commerce. This is a feature introduced on Taobao, one of Alibaba’s main Chinese e-commerce apps, this year that provides deliveries of certain products in China within an hour\n\nCompetition is intense in China, with rivals including food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com, all involved. And the rivalry is already taking its toll on some of these firms, with Meituan this week posting an 89% plunge in second-quarter adjusted net profit.\n\nAlibaba’s own quick commerce division\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Alibaba attributed the increase in profit to gains in some of its equity investments and the disposal of Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol. This was offset by a decrease in income from operations.\\n\\nHowever, excluding investment gains, Alibaba’s net income would have decreased 18% year-on-year as it continues to invest in the cut-throat instant commerce space in China.\\n\\nAlibaba is carrying out a delicate balancing act between investing areas such as artificial intelligence and new e-commerce models, while showing that it can continue to grow in China’s competitive market. So far, investors have rewarded Alibaba with a 40% rally in its U.S.-listed stock this year.\\n\\nThat’s partly thanks a continued growth acceleration at its key cloud computing division as well as improvements at both its China and international e-commerce businesses.\\n\\nCloud accelerates\\nCloud computing was one of the bright spots.\\n\\nAlibaba said revenue at the division totaled 33.4 billion yuan, up 26% year-on-year. That was faster than the 18% growth rate seen in the previous quarter. Alibaba’s cloud unit is seen as key to the company monetizing artificial intelligence, much like Microsoft or Google.\\n\\n“Driven by robust AI demand, Cloud Intelligence Group experienced accelerated revenue growth, and AI-related product revenue is now a significant portion of revenue from external customers,” Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said in a statement.\\n\\nInvestors are focused on Alibaba’s investments in artificial intelligence, where it has become a major global player. The company has aggressively launched various AI models and is selling services through its cloud computing division.\\n\\nWhile Alibaba has focused open source AI — meaning its models can be used for free and built on by developers — it also sells AI services through its cloud unit.\\n\\nAlibaba said AI-related product revenue “maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.”\\n\\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA), a measure of profitability, jumped 26% year-on-year in the cloud unit.\\n\\nAlibaba management said on Friday that the aim for the company is to keep the cloud growth rate above the market average, rather than to raise gross margins in the near term.\\n\\n‘Quick commerce’ wars\\nAlibaba’s core e-commerce business, which accounts for more than 50% of revenue, had mixed results.\\n\\nOverall, revenue rose 10% year-on-year to 19.6 billion yuan. Customer management revenue, which Alibaba makes off of selling marketing and other services to merchants on its platform, jumped 10%. CMR accounts for the bulk of e-commerce revenue.\\n\\nHowever, adjusted earnings in the division fell 21% in the quarter on an annual basis. That’s because Alibaba has been investing heavily in so-called quick or instant commerce. This is a feature introduced on Taobao, one of Alibaba’s main Chinese e-commerce apps, this year that provides deliveries of certain products in China within an hour\\n\\nCompetition is intense in China, with rivals including food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com, all involved. And the rivalry is already taking its toll on some of these firms, with Meituan this week posting an 89% plunge in second-quarter adjusted net profit.\\n\\nAlibaba’s own quick commerce division\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba is a major Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing, recently experiencing revenue growth despite some challenges.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nanjing\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Nanjing is a city in Jiangsu province, China, where Alibaba's office building is located.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jiangsu\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Jiangsu is a province in China, noted as the location of Alibaba's office building in Nanjing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Hong Kong Stock Exchange\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is a major financial market where Alibaba recently transitioned its listing status to dual primary.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"New York Stock Exchange\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The New York Stock Exchange is a prominent stock market where Alibaba is also listed as a dual primary company.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eddie Wu\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Eddie Wu is Alibaba's CEO, who commented on the company's growth and strategies related to cloud computing and AI.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cloud Computing Unit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba's Cloud Computing Unit is a significant division experiencing accelerated growth and contributing to AI-related revenues.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"AI-related Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"AI-related Revenue refers to income generated from artificial intelligence products and services provided by Alibaba.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Instant Commerce\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Instant Commerce is a service offered by Alibaba that provides quick product deliveries within an hour in China through its Taobao platform.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"Nanjing\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba's office building is located in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, indicating the company's presence in the city.\\\"<|>\\\"headquarters, location\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"Hong Kong Stock Exchange\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba transitioned its listing status to dual primary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, emphasizing its market presence.\\\"<|>\\\"listing, financial markets\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"New York Stock Exchange\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba is also dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange, showcasing its international operations.\\\"<|>\\\"listing, financial markets\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eddie Wu\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"Eddie Wu, as CEO, leads Alibaba's strategy, especially in cloud computing and AI investments.\\\"<|>\\\"leadership, strategy\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cloud Computing Unit\\\"<|>\\\"AI-related Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"The Cloud Computing Unit of Alibaba generates significant AI-related revenue, indicating a strong link between technology and income streams.\\\"<|>\\\"technology impact, revenue growth\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba\\\"<|>\\\"Instant Commerce\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba’s investment in Instant Commerce reflects its response to competitive pressures in the e-commerce market in China.\\\"<|>\\\"market strategy, competition\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Alibaba, cloud computing, AI, e-commerce, market dynamics, financial performance\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

    "return": "### Latest Results for Alibaba\n\nAlibaba reported its revenue for the fiscal quarter ending June, posting a total revenue of 247.65 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $34.6 billion), reflecting a 2% year-on-year increase. Although this growth was noted, it fell short of analyst expectations, prompting a response in the stock market where Alibaba shares saw a jump of 6% in premarket trading.\n\nThe company's net income significantly rose to 43.11 billion yuan, up 78% compared to prior results, largely attributed to gains from equity investments and the disposal of Trendyol, a Turkish e-commerce firm. Despite these gains, adjusted earnings from operations fell 18% if investment gains are excluded, highlighting the ongoing challenges in maintaining profitability amidst heavy investments in instant commerce.\n\nAlibaba's cloud computing unit showed promising growth, bringing in 33.4 billion yuan, which is a 26% increase year-on-year. Notably, revenue from artificial intelligence-related products also continued to grow at triple-digit rates for the eighth consecutive quarter. However, this boost in revenue is coupled with substantial investments in their instant commerce division, which delivers products within an hour through their Taobao app, making competition in the Chinese market increasingly intense, particularly against rivals like JD.com and Meituan.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDespite surpassing expectations on net income and showing robust growth in its cloud computing and AI segments, Alibaba faces challenges due to fierce competition in the instant commerce space and a slight miss on overall revenue forecasts.\n\n### References\n- [KG] Alibaba\n- [KG] Q4 2023 Results - Services Revenue\n- [DC] [EARNINGS_REPORT] \n- [DC] [SEC_FILING] \n- [DC] [SEC_FILING] ",
