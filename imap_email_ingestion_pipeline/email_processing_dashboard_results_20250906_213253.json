        "body": "Summary:\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, China's best robotaxi player (in terms of the algo /\r\nmodel). Aims to be gross margin break even on robotaxi operations by end\r\n2025 or (if delayed) 1Q26e. Call fleshes out some details behind the current\r\nadvancements in robotaxi tech. More for read through on China's robotaxi and\r\nLIDAR industry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIPO 27 Nov 2024 at $13/ ADR. At $17.095 / share, market cap is at US$5.96bn\r\n& EV is US$6.92b. 2024E revenue US$74.67m and PATMI of -145m. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFY24e EV/Sales of 92.7x.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBusiness Description:\r\n\r\nFounded in 2016, in Silicon Valley, Pony.ai has quickly become a global\r\nleader in autonomous mobility and is a pioneer in extending autonomous\r\nmobility technologies and services at a rapidly expanding footprint of sites\r\naround the world. Operating Robotaxi, Robotruck and Personally Owned Vehicle\r\n(POV) business units, Pony.ai is an industry leader in the commercialisation\r\nof autonomous driving. In 2022, Pony.ai became the first autonomous company\r\nto receive a licence to operate its self-driving taxis in China.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompany Update Group Conference Call\r\n\r\nGeorge Shao (Senior Director - Financing, Investment and Strategy)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGross margin positive on robotaxi operation by the end of 2025. If we can\r\nbreakeven on robotaxi operation, not on licensing or robotruck etc. If we\r\ncan do this right in Tier 1 cities, we can duplicate in other cities. To hit\r\n50 - 100k fleet size, there will be a need to be heavily reliant on renting\r\ncars (to be asset light) and running them as robotaxis. His calculations is\r\nat a fleet size of 30-50k Pony.ai's robotaxis in tier 1 cities, they can\r\nreach group level profitability at the net income or free cash flow level.\r\nPony.ai plans to run 600 robotaxis by end of 2025 vs 100 in 2024.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Robotaxi operation will enable us to maximise the max revenue and profits\r\nwe will get - not by selling the software / hardware. ADAS don't make money\r\nhere or anywhere in the world. Any software L2 is L3 in my mind - they both\r\nrequire a driver. People don't pay anything to OEM for subscription based\r\nmodel so OEM don't pay a lot to tier 1 software companies. In China, tier 1\r\nsoftware companies cannot make money. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you charge people for mileage, carry passenger, then you can make money.\r\nWe are laser focused on 1 thing right - robotaxi operation, making money by\r\nmileage. We are focused on tier 1 cities.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLicense to operate Robotaxis in Tier 1 cities: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlans to mass produce with Beijing auto and Guangzhou auto in 2025 - vehicle\r\ncoming down from production line in June 2025. After which, it takes 2\r\nmonths to get the license as this is their 7th generation robotaxis before\r\ntaking passengers in September. Their 5/6th generation ones are already\r\nlicensed previously. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPony.ai is the only driverless player in China to get the licenses from all\r\ntier 1 cities. Weride & Baidu are not able to do so. You can only get the\r\npermit if you prove that your safety / speed on the road is adequate amongst\r\nmany other things. Weride & Baidu robotaxis drives slowly and blocks traffic\r\n+ their AI isn't as good compared to us. Their autonomous driving is by\r\nremotely driving the vehicle instead of remotely assisting the vehicle (they\r\nhave an operator behind a steering wheel whereas Pony's operators use a\r\nmouse to choose how to rectify issues and the car will reverse etc and\r\ndecide how much to turn, how far back to reverse on its own). Our operator\r\nonly sees 12 screens, he will see if there's any input needed, he can even\r\ndeny assisting the vehicle. No one is holding a steering wheel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was mentioning about this picture where PM Lee visited WeRide where\r\nthere's operators behind steering wheels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nL2/L3 vs L4\r\n\r\nDr Tiancheng Lou (CTO and Co-founder Pony.ai) has done a lot of interviews\r\nwith Chinese reporters. In summary, the better you do on L2/L3, the further\r\naway you are from L4. BYD, Nio, XPeng etc the L2/L3 companies, their\r\nmethodology is to learn from human data, to sell as many cars as possible\r\nand learn from them. You can develop very quickly by learning from human\r\napproach but there is an upper limit to it where you can't surpass the human\r\nbeing in terms of safety etc. Pony.ai realized this 5/6 years ago and they\r\ndon't learn form humans, but instead via practice. Reinforced learning\r\ninstead of imitation learning. Pony.ai establishes the work model by\r\nthemselves, to train and drive itself. \"If you don't surpass human, you\r\ncan't run robotaxi\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Deepseek of autonomous driving\"\r\n\r\nPony.ai uses less powerful chips to do better things. Compared to waymo, we\r\nuse L2 kinda chips to do L4 things. Google waymo still uses 2 H100 chips in\r\nthe trunk of their vehicle (super expensive, a lot of computing power).\r\nPony.ai uses NVIDIA Orin-X chips (40/50 times cheaper than the H100s) as our\r\nalgo is better than theirs. Even for LIDAR, we can use L2 lidars to do L4.\r\nFor L4 lidars, the point cloud is much denser, quality much higher, distance\r\nlonger than L2 lidars. A L4 lidar by waymo is >$10k each. The lidar that\r\nPony.ai uses are the auto grade lidar (the same as Li Auto or Xpeng etc),\r\nits Hesai AT128s, 2-3k rmb each. Waymo has 1 collusion every 30/40k miles,\r\nPony.ai is 150k miles. Waymo burns 2.5-3bn usd a year, Pony.ai burns 100m\r\nusd a year. A lot of investors say we are the deepseek of autonomous\r\ndriving, using way less complicated hardware to accomplish a lot more. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCost per robotaxi / density of taxis\r\n\r\nToday, our mass produced vehicle, lidar chips sensors plus car, is 280k rmb\r\n/ car. This is 7x lower than waymo. Say if we can get 10s of thousands of\r\nvehicles, we can lower that price by a third, which translates to lower\r\ndepreciation or rent on the vehicle. We are doing robotaxi operation, each\r\nvehicle revenue depends on density of the robotaxi that you deploy in a\r\ncity. The average didi driver in China if he is a full time driver in a Tier\r\n1 city who drives 14-16 hours a day, he can get 30 orders a day or more.\r\nToday pony gets 10-20 a day (in the same Tier 1 cities). The China national\r\naverage is 10/15 level. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMarket need for taxis\r\n\r\nEvery 10k people in tier 1 cities needs 400 ride hailing cars. Regardless of\r\nrobotaxi or didi. This means that every 2 million population needs 80k ride\r\nhailing cars. Every district in a Tier 1 city has 2m people, each city has\r\nat least 10 districts. (He is implying that each of the Tier 1 city requires\r\n800k ride hailing cars for a total of maybe 3+m vehicles amongst the 4 Tier\r\n1 cities). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Good morning,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC17FB.E52ACD90]\r\n\r\n28 August 2025\r\n\r\nDBSV Sales Note\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01DC17FB.E52ACD90]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOP IDEA\r\nChina Consumer: The 5E Style\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DC17FB.E52ACD90]<https://researchwise.dbsvresearch.com/ResearchManager/DownloadResearch.aspx?E=igjajkgbcjj>\r\n\r\n*        Over the next decade, we believe sector winners could be characterised by the 5E framework: Experiential, Emotional, Exclusive, E-proficient & Excellence\r\n\r\n*        Accelerated urban growth, Gen Z-driven subcultures (e.g., \"Guzi\", \"Guochao\"), government stimuli, demand from the silver economy and a growing affluence group, along with more therapeutic spending amid AI-related job fears could all spark newer and enduring consumption trends\r\n\r\n*        We rank 15 sub-segments through our 5E lens, balancing medium-term outlooks with near-term catalysts to identify our top picks, including Pop Mart<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5079208968>, Midea<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5000006171>, Mixue<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5079690356>, Anta<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5000431356>, Luk Fook<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295871713>, Galaxy<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295871207>, CR Beer<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295871002> and YUM China<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5051778285?source=pdfwatchlist&sourceid=tmp&subsource=&logincode=true>.\r\n\r\nWhat we think: The 5E framework - Experiential shifts (prioritizing immersive experiences), Emotional drivers (value-based spending focused on cultural pride like Guochao and mental well-being), Exclusive tastes (personalization), E-proficient behaviors (digital experience), and a focus on Excellence (premium quality and health efficacy for longevity) - is anticipated to shape China's consumer evolution over the next decade and beyond. This evolution is driven by rapid urbanization and declining birth rates, leading to increased demand for city-style leisure and a shift towards emotional consumption, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials. Government policies, including trade-in subsidies, mortgage rate cuts, and the Three-Year Action Plan, are bolstering consumption in home appliances, NEVs, and digital, green, and health sectors. An aging population and growing affluent segment are fuelling demand for eldercare, premium products, and \"quiet luxury\" (craftsmanship, exclusivity, cultural authenticity). The \"Guochao\" (national pride) movement, led by Gen Z and Millennials, is projected to exceed RMB3 trillion by 2028, while the rapid advancement of AI and automation is increasing stress-driven consumption and demand for mental well-being products.\r\n\r\nOur report identifies fast-growing or resilient industries in the near term, such as pop toys, retail beverages, home appliances, selected sportswear and luxury brands, Macau gaming, restaurants, and certain F&B sectors. Companies like Pop Mart, Midea, Mixue, Anta, Luk Fook, Galaxy, CR Beer, and YUM China are highlighted as being well-aligned with the 5E pillars, capturing shifts towards cultural pride, scarcity, and experiential consumption. These major players offer calibrated exposure to China's redefined consumption drivers, moving beyond pure materialism.\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's Events\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   4:00pm - BaTeLab (2149 HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Thailand Focus 2025 Conference (Physical in TH)\r\n\r\n\r\n29 August 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   11:30am - Horizon Robotics Inc (9660 HK) (Virtual / Physical in HK, Putonghua)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   3:30pm - Newborn Town (9911 HK) (Physical in HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   4:30pm - ENN Energy (2688 HK) (Putonghua)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Thailand Focus 2025 Conference (Physical in TH)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick here<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/corporateaccess> to see all of our upcoming corporate and analyst access events!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITAL / DISRUPTION\r\nMeituan: 2Q missed, Competition Pummelled Profits\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DC17FB.E52ACD90]<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5050303579?source=landing&pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=27655>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Adjusted earnings dropped 89% y/y to RMB1.5bn in 2Q25, 84% behind market expectations, with core local commerce's operating profit margin narrowed significantly to 5.7% in 2Q25 (vs. 21.0% in 1Q25)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Management expects core local commerce (CLC) to record a loss in 3Q25, while remain confident to maintain market leader position and expect food delivery operating profit margin will gradually return to FY24's c.3% (from GTV level) as irrational competition scales down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   While short-term profitability will remain under pressure, we expect Meituan's market-leading position to sustain alongside solid progress in global expansion. Maintain BUY; TP under review\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we think: Meituan's 2Q25 results fell significantly below market expectations, primarily due to higher-than-anticipated subsidies in its food delivery business. This led to a substantial 76% y/y drop in core local commerce operating profit and a 43% year-over-year expansion in the operating loss for the new initiatives segment, driven by Keeta's overseas expansion. Management anticipates the core local commerce segment will record a loss in Q3 2025 due to intensified competition during the summer peak season, as they continue to invest in market share defense. Despite this, Meituan is expected to maintain market leadership given its superior supply and service quality, particularly through its differentiated value-for-money offerings. On the overseas front, Keeta has shown encouraging progress, expanding to over 20 cities in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with management confident in its long-term potential to achieve RMB100 billion in gross transaction volume by 2033. While short-term profitability will remain under pressure, we maintain a BUY rating on Meituan, with the target price under review, and anticipate the company's market leadership will endure alongside solid progress in global expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMER\r\nAstra International: Offering deep value\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DC17FB.E52ACD90]<https://researchwise.dbsvresearch.com/ResearchManager/DownloadResearch.aspx?E=igihckfhedf>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Avanza/Veloz/Xenia hybrid launches on the horizon, with potential to add ~10-12k units annually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   An aligned Total Shareholder Return (TSR) program with shareholders could drive ASII's transformation going forward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Maintain BUY with a higher TP of IDR6,500; Astra offers value with drivers including its hybrid shift and strategic review\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we think: We lift our TP to Rp6,500 (from Rp5,870) as we roll forward our valuation to FY26F. At a 7.2x FY26F P/E, we think Astra continues to offer value, backed by a high dividend yield (~7-8%), while the market awaits details of a strategic review. We also see margin support from Astra's financial services business, which continues to maintain above-market returns even amid volume softness.\r\nAstra's Total Shareholder Return plan is key to watch, particularly following the announcement by its majority shareholder, Jardine Cycle & Carriage (JC&C), in March 2025. While the timing of ASII's TSR announcement remains unclear at this stage, we believe the announcement will be positive for the share price performance. Recent moves suggest broadening exposure beyond its core automotive and heavy equipment segments, eg increasing its stake in Hermina Hospital and the acquisition of Mega Manunggal. We believe the divestment of non-core assets is a possibility, particularly its palm oil plantation business.\r\n\r\nWilliam believes Astra's push into hybrid (new launches Avanza/Veloz/Xenia) could help it recover the ~1.2ppt market share loss from 2024. Based on our estimates, this launch could generate incremental volume of 10-12k units per year, which could defend Astra's 4W market share at ~57%, vs. 53.7% in 7M25 and 52.6% in our base-case FY25F. We assess the government's potential initiative to limit BEV fiscal incentives as a positive step, creating momentum for locally produced hybrid vehicles to capture a greater share of the electrification market. The newly launched Rocky Hybrid secured ~100-200 SPK, which is a far cry from BYD Atto 1's 8k SPK, however William believes the different price points suggest segmentation is still at play.

Excellence (premium quality and health efficacy for longevity) &#8211; is anticipated to shape China's consumer evolution over the next\r\n decade and beyond. This evolution is driven by rapid urbanization and declining birth rates, leading to increased demand for city-style leisure and a shift towards emotional consumption, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials. Government policies, including\r\n trade-in subsidies, mortgage rate cuts, and the Three-Year Action Plan, are bolstering consumption in home appliances, NEVs, and digital, green, and health sectors. An aging population and growing affluent segment are fuelling demand for eldercare, premium\r\n products, and &quot;quiet luxury&quot; (craftsmanship, exclusivity, cultural authenticity). The &quot;Guochao&quot; (national pride) movement, led by Gen Z and Millennials, is projected to exceed RMB3 trillion by 2028, while the rapid advancement of AI and automation is increasing\r\n stress-driven consumption and demand for mental well-being products.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:16.75pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:16.75pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">Our report identifies fast-growing or resilient industries in the near term, such as pop toys, retail beverages, home appliances, selected sportswear and luxury\r\n brands, Macau gaming, restaurants, and certain F&amp;B sectors.

This led to a substantial 76% y/y drop in core local commerce operating profit and a 43% year-over-year expansion in the operating loss for the new\r\n initiatives segment, driven by Keeta's overseas expansion. Management anticipates the core local commerce segment will record a loss in Q3 2025 due to intensified competition during the summer peak season, as they continue to invest in market share defense.\r\n Despite this, Meituan is expected to maintain market leadership given its superior supply and service quality, particularly through its differentiated value-for-money offerings. On the overseas front, Keeta has shown encouraging progress, expanding to over\r\n 20 cities in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with management confident in its long-term potential to achieve RMB100 billion in gross transaction volume by 2033. While short-term profitability will remain under pressure, we maintain a BUY rating on Meituan, with the\r\n target price under review, and anticipate the company's market leadership will endure alongside solid progress in global expansion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:12.45pt\">\r\n<td width=\"605\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:453.75pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:12.45pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:15.0pt\">\r\n<td width=\"202\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:151.25pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:15.0pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">CONSUMER<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:#C00000;mso-ligatures:none\">Astra International: Offering deep value<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;mso-ligatures:none\"><a href=\"https://researchwise.dbsvresearch.com/ResearchManager/DownloadResearch.aspx?E=igihckfhedf\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:windowtext;text-decoration:none\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"77\" height=\"26\" style=\"width:.8in;height:.275in\" id=\"Picture_x0020_23\" src=\"cid:image003.png@01DC17FB.E52ACD90\"></span></a></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"403\" colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:302.5pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:15.0pt\">\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo8\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Avanza/Veloz/Xenia hybrid launches on the horizon, with potential to add ~10-12k units annually\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo8\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">An aligned Total Shareholder Return (TSR) program with shareholders could drive ASII&#8217;s transformation going forward<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo8\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Maintain BUY with a higher TP of IDR6,500; Astra offers value with drivers including its hybrid shift and strategic review\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:12.45pt\">\r\n<td width=\"605\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:453.75pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:12.45pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">What we think:</span></b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"> We lift our TP to Rp6,500 (from\r\n Rp5,870) as we roll forward our valuation to FY26F.

While the timing of ASII's TSR announcement remains unclear at this stage, we believe the announcement will be positive for the share price performance. Recent moves suggest broadening exposure beyond its core automotive and heavy equipment segments,\r\n eg increasing its stake in Hermina Hospital and the acquisition of Mega Manunggal.

Based on our estimates,\r\n this launch could generate incremental volume of 10-12k units per year, which could defend Astra&#8217;s 4W market share at ~57%, vs. 53.7% in 7M25 and 52.6% in our base-case FY25F. We assess the government&#8217;s potential initiative to limit BEV fiscal incentives as\r\n a positive step, creating momentum for locally produced hybrid vehicles to capture a greater share of the electrification market. The newly launched Rocky Hybrid secured ~100-200 SPK, which is a far cry from BYD Atto 1&#8217;s 8k SPK, however William believes the\r\n different price points suggest segmentation is still at play.

Novo Nordisk jumps after Wegovy data\r\nEuropean shares finished marginally higher on Monday (Sep 1), supported by defence stocks, while Novo Nordisk gained after data showed its weight-loss drug Wegovy delivers stronger heart-protective benefits than Eli Lilly\u2019s rival therapies.\r\n \r\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 closed up 0.23 per cent at 551.43, with gains led by the aerospace and defence index, which surged 2.1 per cent to hover near a record high.\r\n \r\nDefence giants, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Rheinmetall and Hensoldt advanced between 2.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent.\r\n \r\nGains followed a Financial Times report that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe was preparing \u201cpretty precise plans\u201d to send troops to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe possibility of additional support for Ukraine can only be beneficial as far as (European) stocks are concerned and investors are really buying into that,\u201d said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.\r\n \r\nBritain\u2019s BAE Systems was up 1.8 per cent, as Norway said that it had chosen Britain for the acquisition of new frigates, in a deal worth some \u00a310 billion (S$17 billion).\r\n \r\nDanish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, the fourth-largest healthcare company on the Stoxx index, rose 1.8 per cent after the company said that Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death by 57 per cent versus Eli Lilly\u2019s rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound in a real-world comparison.\r\n \r\nThe stock bolstered the healthcare index, rising 0.27 per cent. Denmark\u2019s main stock index gained 1.1 per cent, also aided by Novo\u2019s domestic peer Zealand Pharma that ended 3.5 per cent higher.\r\n \r\nOverall gains were limited by a jump in long-dated euro zone bond yields on persistent worries about government debt levels around the world.\r\n \r\nGermany\u2019s 30-year yield rose as much as to a 14-year peak of 3.381 per cent before cooling to 3.36 per cent, up two basis points.\r\n \r\nUtilities, often traded as a bond proxy, fell 0.9 per cent to lead sectoral losses on the Stoxx 600.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, US tariff policy remained a key focus after a US appeals court ruled on Friday that most of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are illegal, but left them in place until mid-October to permit further appeals.\r\n \r\nTrump has vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court and trade experts say the administration is preparing alternative plans to be able to proceed with its tariffs.\r\n \r\nThe European Union has struck a deal with the US, while the Swiss continue to negotiate, although broader trade uncertainty has subsided since April.\r\n \r\nGoldman Sachs was the latest among major brokerages to raise its Stoxx 600 target for the next 12 months, lifting it to 580 from 570.\r\n \r\nOrsted gained 3.5 per cent after Norway\u2019s Equinor pledged to support its planned US$9.4 billion rights issue as the Danish offshore wind developer seeks to bolster its balance sheet as both companies navigate regulatory hurdles in the US offshore wind market.\r\n \r\nOn the data front, euro zone manufacturing activity expanded in August for the first time since mid-2022 due to a surge in domestic demand and output.\r\n \r\nInvestors geared up for this week\u2019s US jobs report, which could sway expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy move at its meeting later this month.\r\n \r\nTrading was light throughout the day due to a US holiday.

The US benchmark, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contract, was up 67 US cents, or 1.1 per cent at US$64.68 by 2.15 pm ET.\r\n \r\nThere will be no settlement for WTI futures on Monday due to Labor Day holiday in the US Trading volume for both Brent and WTI was also muted due to that reason.\r\n \r\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday vowed to retaliate against Russian drone strikes on power facilities in his country\u2019s north and south, and ordered more strikes deep inside Russia.\r\n \r\nThree and a half years into the war, both Russia and Ukraine have intensified airstrikes in recent weeks, even as efforts are underway to resolve the crisis.\r\n \r\nMarkets remain concerned about Russian oil flows, with weekly shipments from its ports dropping to a four-week low of 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd), according to tanker tracker data cited by ANZ analysts.\r\n \r\nElsewhere, the US labour market report this week will give a read on the economy\u2019s health and test investor confidence that interest rate cuts are coming soon, a view that has strengthened appetite for riskier assets such as commodities.\r\n \r\nAhead of the data, the US dollar was close to a five-week low on Monday, making oil less expensive for buyers using other currencies.\r\n \r\nInvestors were also focused on Beijing, where Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are attending a regional summit.\r\n \r\nChina\u2019s manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in August in five months, a private-sector survey showed on Monday. That helped lend support to oil and copper prices, SEB commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note to clients on Monday.\r\n \r\nAlso on the radar was an Opec+ meeting on Sep 7.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe next key fundamental question is whether Opec+ oil producers will continue to raise the group\u2019s output targets beyond September, with a decision due within days,\u201d analyst Tim Evans said in the newsletter Evans on Energy.\r\n \r\nComing out of the summer season, oil inventories should rise in the last quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, HSBC analysts said in a note, with a surplus of 1.6 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter.\r\n \r\nHigher Opec+ supply and rising stockpiles could keep pressure on oil prices after both Brent and WTI registered their first monthly declines in four months in August, losing 6 per cent or more.\r\n \r\n\u201cOil practitioners will continue to curb their enthusiasm,\u201d PVM analyst John Evans said in a note, citing the increased Opec+ supply.

Following its acquisition in August 2024 of a new subsidiary engaged in the wholesale trade of fertilisers, it has been seeking suitable and profitable corporate, business and financing opportunities to enhance shareholders\u2019 value.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe board believes that the proposed acquisition will provide an opportunity for the company to venture into a new business area that has potential for growth,\u201d the release reads. In addition, Exquisite Mode\u2019s proven track record of profitability will enhance the long-term interests of AsiaPhos, it adds.\r\n \r\nExquisite Mode\u2019s assets are also in close proximity to the Johor Rapid Transit System (RTS) station, which positions AsiaPhos to ride on the future growth of the Singapore\u2013Johor Special Economic Zone, which is expected to drive demand for quality real estate, hospitality and related services.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nCity Developments completes sale of stake in South Beach to IOI Properties for RM2.75 bil\r\n \r\nCity Developments Limited (CDL)\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Ascent View Holdings has completed the disposal of its stake in Scottsdale Properties, the holding company of South Beach Consortium.\r\n \r\nAscent View Holdings sold its 50.1% stake to IOI Properties Group, which already owned 49.9% of Scottsdale, for RM2.75 billion. This sale gives the Malaysian developer full ownership over the South Beach mixed-used development, which includes South Beach Tower, South Beach Avenue, and the JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach.\r\n \r\nIOI has paid $835.29 million in cash, inclusive of the deposit of $41.25 million previously paid, to CDL.\r\n \r\nTransparency and prudence guide ValueMax shares to record high\r\nCFO Carol Liew has played a pivotal role in the company\u2019s success, having gradually cultivated these values since taking office in 2012 \r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Shares of pawnbroker ValueMax have been on a tear.\r\n \r\nAfter a 33 per cent jump in 2024, the counter has climbed another 94.2 per cent so far this year to hit an all-time high.\r\n \r\nDid ValueMax get lucky? Or is it merely a beneficiary of wider macroeconomic trends?\r\n \r\nValueMax\u2019s success, the group believes, is due to its commitment to transparency and prudence. And for this, chief financial officer (CFO) Carol Liew has played a pivotal role \u2013 having gradually cultivated these values since taking office in 2012.\r\n \r\nLiew was awarded the Best CFO for mid-cap companies in 2024 for playing a significant role in supporting, advocating and promoting good corporate governance, disclosure and transparency.\r\n \r\nLiew told The Business Times that transparency with shareholders and creditors is a core part of the company\u2019s strategy.\r\n \r\nShareholders need to understand what is going on through financial statements, she said.\r\n \r\n\u201cWhen we do rights issues and capital exercises, we are very well supported by our shareholders,\u201d she added.\r\n \r\nBut ValueMax needs to look to its creditors too, which Liew acknowledged was \u201cequally as important\u201d.\r\n \r\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re comfortable with us, they know where we are at, how we handle things and they see how we prudently manage our finances. Creditors will be comfortable in supporting our growth through extending to us more facilities,\u201d she noted.\r\n \r\nAccording to their financial report, over 95 per cent of ValueMax\u2019s loan book is backed by tangible assets such as gold, diamonds and properties.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe monitor the gold price movement very closely, and we also apply prudent loan-to-value ratios,\u201d she said, noting that the assets are not just for converting, but also for its money-lending business.\r\n \r\nValueMax has a relatively prudent debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3, which is \u201cconservatively leveraged\u201d within the pawnbroking industry, noted the FY2024 report. However, the loan-to-value ratio was not explicitly stated in their financial reports.\r\n \r\nRetail and trading of jewellery and gold was a very significant growth driver for ValueMax in H1 2025, contributing around S$204.8 million in revenue, up 17.5 per cent from a year ago. It only accounts for one out of three of its core business segments, with the others being its pawnbroking and money-lending segments.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s pawnbroking segment was up 20.2 per cent to S$28.1 million, while revenue from the money-lending segment rose 10.7 per cent to S$35.4 million. Overall, its H1 2025 revenue was up 16.8 per cent to S$268.3 million, compared with S$229.8 million a year ago.\r\n \r\nNot a sunset industry\r\n\u201cPawnbroking, compared to 15 years ago, is very different,\u201d Liew said.\r\n \r\nIn the past, pawnshops were associated with dimly lit premises and counters with metal bars to prevent theft \u2013 it was slightly daunting, she said.\r\n \r\n\u201cYou did not want to be caught outside a pawnshop, as it was not a very good image,\u201d she added.\r\n \r\nBut times have changed and now pawnshops have changed their focus to look more \u201cretail\u201d, she said, noting that they should no longer be seen as a \u201clast resort\u201d.\r\n \r\n\u201cEvery pawner is actually an asset owner,\u201d she said.\r\n \r\nValueMax\u2019s finance team includes a financial controller, group accountant and business analysts, with people from different age groups. Liew emphasises the need to hire young talents and train them, while also hiring people with experience in the pawnbroking industry.\r\n \r\nBeyond just hiring, she also seeks to empower the team by giving them a good working environment, which includes encouraging them to come up with new ideas for improvement and voicing their concerns.\r\n \r\nMore acquisitions in a volatile world\r\n\u201cWe will continue to look for opportunities to grow organically, as well as through acquisitions,\u201d she said.\r\n \r\nShe notes that it is also important to keep track of their competitors. This ensures that ValueMax knows what its strengths are and how to grow accordingly. She acknowledges that it can be distracting to be overfocused on competitors, but emphasises the need to \u201ctake surveys of the land\u201d.\r\n \r\nThe group acquired Heng Heng Pawnshop and Ban Fook Pawnshop in March 2025 as part of its expansion plans within Singapore.\r\n \r\nLiew added that ValueMax is \u201cnot adverse\u201d to exploring complementary businesses. Without going into the specifics, she hinted that it is looking into micro-financing and scaling up its money-lending business.\r\n \r\nGuocoLand unit divests Thistle Johor Bahru hotel for RM150 million\r\nThe group is expected to enjoy a net gain of about RM35 million upon completion of the sale\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Property developer GuocoLand is selling the Thistle Johor Bahru hotel and the associated land for RM150 million (S$46 million).\r\n \r\nThe hotel and the land in Bandar Johor Bahru, held by GuocoLand\u2019s subsidiary JB Parade, is being sold to Restoran Kisap, a wholly owned subsidiary of YTL Hotels & Properties.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe transaction provides an opportunity to realise the capital value of the property and the assets,\u201d said GuocoLand in a bourse filing on Monday (Sep 1). \r\n \r\nThe combined property has a net book value of RM93 million, with the land area at about 24,040 square metres. GuocoLand is thus expected to enjoy a net gain of about RM35 million upon completion of the sale. \r\n \r\nThe Business Times understands that JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group brokered the deal. \r\n \r\nThistle Johor Bahru is located within a 10-minute drive of the land border to Singapore, the world\u2019s busiest land border crossing. It has 381 rooms featuring a mix of 347 rooms with city and sea views and 34 suites. It also has six food and beverage outlets, a two-level resort-style swimming pool, a spa, a fitness centre, tennis courts, as well as meeting and banqueting facilities. \r\n \r\nAs at 9.07 am on Friday (Aug 29), shares of GuocoLand had declined 2.7 per cent or S$0.05 to S$1.83 on the back of lower H2 net profit of S$32.4 million. \r\nGuocoLand falls by nearly 3% after reporting slump in H2 net profit to S$32.4 million\r\nAnother GuocoLand hotel in Malaysia, Thistle Port Dickson Resort, is also on the market, reported The Edge.\r\n \r\nOn Aug 29, the group announced that its second-half net profit fell 48 per cent as China losses offset Singapore growth. This was despite a 20.3 per cent jump in revenue.\r\n \r\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding soars on the back of new orders worth US$920 million\r\nThe company secures additional shipbuilding contracts for 22 vessels\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Shares of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding soared 6.5 per cent shortly after market open on Monday (Sep 1) on the back of its announcement that it has secured 22 new orders for its vessels.\r\n \r\nThe counter jumped S$0.19 to S$3.10 as at 9.29 am, having closed at S$2.91 on Aug 29. \r\n \r\nThe Chinese shipbuilder announced the new orders worth US$920 million after the market closed that day.\r\n \r\nThe new vessels are due for deliveries between 2027 and 2029, and will not \u201chave any significant impact on the earnings\u201d for 2025, it said.\r\n \r\nThe new orders mean that Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has secured orders with an aggregate value of nearly US$1.5 billion in the year to date.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nCathay Cineplexes ceases operations as talks with creditors fall through\r\nParent company mm2 Asia will wind up the cinema chain, which is unable to continue as a going concern\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Struggling cinema chain Cathay Cineplexes has ceased operations as of Monday (Sep 1), shortly after its voluntary liquidation was announced earlier in the day. \r\n \r\nThe cinema chain, which owes money to landlords of several of its outlets, will undergo voluntary liquidation, said its parent company mm2 Asia : 1B0 0%.  \r\n \r\n\u201cCathay Cineplexes had attempted to negotiate amicable resolutions with the various creditors, but (it) was unable to arrive at mutually agreeable restructuring outcomes of its payment obligations owed to these creditors,\u201d said the media company, which operates the cinema chain.  \r\n \r\nIn an Instagram post on Monday, the cinema chain said that it had \u201cceased operations with immediate effect\u201d. \r\n \r\nIts website displayed no movie screenings as at Monday 11.48 am, although four cinema venues remained listed on the site. These are its Causeway Point, Downtown East, Century Square and Clementi outlets. \r\n \r\nHaving considered the cinema chain\u2019s financial position and the absence of restructuring outcomes, the board of Cathay Cineplexes has determined that it is \u201cno longer feasible\u201d for it to continue operating as a going concern, mm2 Asia said. \r\n \r\nThe board will proceed with a creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation of Cathay Cineplexes, said the entertainment group, which recently posted a wider H2 net loss for its financial year ended Mar 31, 2025.  \r\n \r\nAccording to its financials released on Aug 28, mm2 Asia\u2019s net loss for H2 widened by more than 10 times to S$101.3 million, from S$8.7 million in the year-ago period, as fewer projects in the concert and event and cinema business were completed. \r\n \r\nAn extraordinary general meeting of the members of Cathay Cineplexes and a meeting of its creditors will be convened in due course.\r\n \r\nmm2 Asia\u2019s statement named as claimants DBS Trustee, the trustee of Lendlease Global Commercial Reit, and the landlords of Century Square mall, Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2193 and Century Square LLP. \r\n \r\nIt also named HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore), the trustee of Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT), Lendlease Retail Investments 3 (in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation), Alprop and Resorts Concept.  \r\n \r\nIn recent months, Cathay Cineplexes received millions in payment demands from landlords of its outlets over rental arrears and other monies owed. \r\n \r\nThis came alongside a string of cinema outlet closures, with its Jem outlet shuttering in March and its West Mall outlet winding down in February. \r\n \r\nIn January, the cinema chain received payment demands for around S$2.7 million from the landlords of its Century Square and Causeway Point outlets. Both malls are owned by FCT. \r\n \r\nAlprop submitted a claim of around S$1 million for the West Mall outlet which closed in February, on behalf of the mall\u2019s landlord UOL Group.  \r\n \r\nThe landlord of its Jem outlet, Lendlease Global Commercial Reit, issued a S$3.4 million payment demand in July. \r\n \r\nmm2 Asia said in July that it was mulling the closure of the cinema chain, as the industry has faced challenges since Covid-19. \r\n \r\nISOTeam's 2HFY2025 earnings below expectations but CGSI raises target price to 10.2 cents on growing project pipeline\r\n \r\nISOTeam's 2HFY2025 numbers were below expectations and new order wins were slower too.\r\n \r\nYet, Natalie Ong and Lim Siew Khee of CGS International have not only maintained their \"add\" call on the stock, they have also raised their target price from 9.6 cents to 10.2 cents, with a view that the company's recurring business model will put it in good stead to enjoy profit and margin recovery.\r\n \r\nFor the half year ended June, ISOTeam, led by CEO Anthony Koh, reported earnings of $5.1 million, down 21% y-o-y, which Ong and Lim attribute to delays in revenue recognition which caused an \"abnormally\" weak half year.\r\n \r\nThe company's order book as at June was $181 million, somewhat lower than $193 million recorded as at the end of the preceding year ended June 2024.\r\n \r\nNonetheless, Ong and Lim believe that demand for the company's services will be well supported by a pipeline of some 100,000 new flats that will be launched between 2022 and 2027.\r\n \r\nIn addition, there are various estate upgrading and enhancement contracts that ISOTeam will presumably bid for.\r\n \r\nOng and Lim note that ISOTeam is moving into a new market segment: upgrading and renovating factory spaces that are being converted into workers' dormitories.\r\n \r\nOn Aug 15, the company announced a collaboration with Design@Loft Architects to this end, where this partner will be responsible for the architectural design and regulatory submissions while ISOTeam will provide upgrading, renovation and construction works.\r\n \r\nISOTeam is now in talks with 4 to 5 such potential clients, and the analysts think there could be more of such contracts given the shortage of worker accommodations in Singapore, as well as a 2030 deadline for all dorms to meet more stringent requirements.\r\n \r\nThey continue to like this stock for its recurring business model and profit and margin recovery and are now applying a valuation multiple of 8x FY2027 earnings, which is a discount of 16% off local listed peers because of its smaller scale, thereby deriving a target price of 10.2 cents.\r\n \r\nFor them, key re-rating catalysts include stronger-than-forecast orderbook growth and potential commercialisation of its BuildTech solutions, which could add new asset leasing revenue and geographical diversification opportunities.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, delays in contract completion and constraints from cost and availability of foreign labour and subcontractors would be downside risks.\\\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nSing Investments & Finance, Advanced Holdings, Koyo Int\u2019l \u2018deeply undervalued opportunities\u2019: Aletheia Capital\r\n \r\nNirguan Tiruchelvam of Aletheia Capital has identified a handful of Singapore Exchange-listed stocks that he believes are \u201cdeeply undervalued opportunities\u201d.\r\n \r\nTo do so, he has applied three valuation metrics to assess balance sheet strength: net cash to market capitalisation, new working capital to market cap and net-net working capital to market cap.\r\n \r\nHe writes in an Aug 28 note: \u201cWe identify Sing Investments & Finance (SIF), Advanced Holdings (ADV) and Koyo International as compelling opportunities among the deep-value players. ADV and Koyo International appear in at least two out of the three deep-value metrics. SIF could benefit from the rise of digital finance.\u201d\r\n \r\nMarket cap to net cash\r\nTiruchelvam\u2019s first rubric is to assess a company\u2019s market cap to net cash. Should a company\u2019s net cash exceed its market cap, Tiruchelvam writes that this implies investors are \u201ceffectively paying nothing\u201d, or even receiving a discount for the core business.\r\n \r\nHe writes: \u201cA stock trading below its net cash value is similar to buying cash at a discount. The rest of the business is thrown in for free. This offers an exceptional margin of safety.\u201d\r\n \r\nAn example that \u201cstands out sharply\u201d among small-caps is SIF, due to what Tiruchelvam calls its \u201cextraordinary\u201d balance sheet strength.\r\n \r\nThe company, with its net cash of around $2.9 billion against a market cap of around $286 million as at Aug 28, implies a market cap to net cash of just 0.1 times versus peers\u2019 0.5 to 0.9 times.\r\n \r\nHe adds: \u201cThis means investors are effectively paying only a fraction of its cash holdings, with the operating business valued at near-zero by the market. Relative to other cash-rich peers trading closer to 0.5 to 0.9 times, SIF\u2019s valuation gap highlights a deep disconnect that could present a compelling re-rating opportunity.\u201d\r\n \r\nThis possibility, Tiruchelvam notes, could come once the market begins to ascribe any value to SIF\u2019s underlying business beyond cash.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, consumer health company Cordlife Group has a net cash ratio of 0.95 times, with its $58 million net cash almost equal to its market cap of $55 million.\r\n \r\nTiruchelvam notes that Cordlife thus \u201cranks near the top\u201d of peers like Trek 2000 and CFM Holdings, suggesting the market is valuing the business close to its cash pile.\r\n \r\n\u201cThis may signal undervaluation if operations are stable or improve. These companies are, by any classic definition, net cash bargains. If their businesses are wound down tomorrow, shareholders could plausibly recover more than the current share price,\u201d writes the analyst.\r\n \r\nDespite this, he adds that investors \u201cshould be wary of traps\u201d, as certain deep cash discounts are a result of legacy issues. These include litigation, poor capital allocation or management entrenchment.\r\n \r\nCordlife has been embroiled in a years-long scandal over its mishandling of cord blood units, forcing the Mainboard-listed company to pay out refunds to its customers.\r\n \r\nTiruchelvam notes that it is therefore \u201cessential to go beyond the numbers\u201d and assess the quality of cash, management intentions and potential catalysts.\r\n \r\nMarket cap to net working capital\r\nTiruchelvam\u2019s second valuation method is to determine whether a company\u2019s net working capital, which includes receivables and inventories, exceeds its market capitalisation.\r\n \r\n\u201cThis suggests that even in the event of liquidation, the shareholders could recover well above current prices from short-term assets alone,\u201d he writes.\r\n \r\nHe sees that several listed small- to mid-caps trade at market cap to net working capital ratios of 0.63 to 0.91 times, implying strong balance sheet support and meaningful downside protection. These include Baker Technology, Cordlife Group, Gallant Venture, Koyo International, Sing Holdings and AP Oil International.\r\n \r\nAlthough Tiruchelvam notes that these firms would deliver value even if liquidated at book value, thus offering investors both safety and upside optionality, \u201ccaution is warranted\u201d.\r\n \r\nExcessive inventories or weak receivables, he adds, could reduce the quality of net working capital and limit actual cash conversion.\r\n \r\nMarket capitalisation to net-net\r\nThe analyst\u2019s third metric, market capitalisation to net-net, is \u201cone of the strictest measures\u201d of value, which entails current assets minus total liabilities.\r\n \r\nTiruchelvam notes that this method assumes fixed assets and intangibles are worthless and focuses only on current assets net of all liabilities.\r\n \r\nHe writes: \u201cCompanies trading at or below this level are considered deeply undervalued. There are potential liquidation gains even in worst-case scenarios.\u201d\r\n \r\nIn this space, he once again identifies Sing Holdings, AP Oil International and Koyo International, as a large share of their market caps is backed by liquid assets after liabilities. This offers strong balance sheet resilience and margin of safety.\r\n \r\nTiruchelvam writes: \u201cThese elevated ratios suggest ample liquidity and a strong margin of safety. It positions itself for potential re-rating as markets begin valuing underlying business fundamentals beyond liquid assets.\u201d\r\n \r\n\u201cBy contrast, firms with ratios above 1.0 trade below their net-net value may carry hidden risks from long-term liabilities,\u201d he adds.\r\n \r\nOther ways of realising value\r\nBeyond pure metrics, Tiruchelvam also sees that recognising stocks for their \u201cintrinsic worth\u201d could come about from a \u201ccontrarian or asymmetrical approach\u201d by investors. This could include factors such as a company\u2019s corporate actions, sector recoveries and balance sheet monetisation.\r\n \r\nOne of the most consistent avenues for unlocking value has been through corporate actions, he adds.\r\n \r\nPrivatisations are a recurring feature of the Singapore market, particularly among family-controlled or state-linked firms, says Tiruchelvam.\r\n \r\nHe cites the privatisation of shipping and logistics provider Goodpack by the US-listed private equity firm KKR & Co in 2014 at an enterprise value (EV) to earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) ratio of about 12 times an example of \u201ccrystallising value for shareholders\u201d who had \u201cendured years\u201d of undervaluation.\r\n \r\n\u201cSimilarly, Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) underwent a high-profile restructuring in 2021, spinning off its media assets before being taken private by the Cuscaden Peak consortium,\u201d adds Tiruchelvam.\r\n \r\nThe unlocking of assets can also act as a catalyst. He notes that Boustead Singapore, which has historically traded at a \u201csteep\u201d discount to its net asset value (NAV), successfully spun off Boustead Projects in 2015, thus \u201callowing the market to assign a clearer valuation\u201d to its industrial real estate portfolio.\r\n \r\nHe adds: \u201cShareholder returns can also be boosted through buybacks and special dividends, as demonstrated by UOL Group, which bought back stock in 2020 when it was trading at approximately 0.6 times book value, helping to narrow the discount.\u201d\r\n \r\nRecoveries\r\nAnother way to value realisation arises can come from sectoral recoveries and cyclical upturns.\r\n \r\n\u201cDepressed cyclicals on SGX have often rerated sharply when industry conditions improved. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding illustrates this dynamic. The company traded at less than five times earnings in 2019 to 2020, only to more than double in value as the global shipbuilding cycle turned upwards,\u201d writes Tiruchelvam.\r\n \r\nAnother example is Keppel Corporation, \u201clong burdened\u201d by its exposure to the offshore and marine sector, has since benefited from restructuring efforts and the rebound in oil services.\r\n \r\nPolicy tailwinds can provide an additional catalyst, with the analyst citing public works contractors OKP Holdings with its order book expansion and share price support during the 2016 to 2019 surge in infrastructure spending by the Land Transport Authority as a beneficiary.\r\n \r\nOf course, the strength of a company\u2019s balance sheet is another \u201cvital lever\u201d for value unlocking, with Tiruchelvam noting that many deep value companies on SGX possess \u201chidden asset bases\u201d that are not adequately reflected in market valuations.\r\n \r\nAccording to him, real estate player Ho Bee Land is one such company, trading at around 0.4 times book value. The company owns a high-quality portfolio of London office assets that \u201ccould be monetised\u201d to close the gap with NAV, he adds.\r\n \r\nTiruchelvam writes: \u201cHwa Hong Corporation followed a similar trajectory. It was long neglected by the market despite trading at a steep discount to its assets. It was eventually privatised in 2022 at a premium.\u201d\r\n \r\nAt the same time, companies with large net cash balances also offer downside protection while providing optionality for future growth or capital return. Technology players Frencken Group and Valuetronics fit this profile, as both traded close to or below net cash levels during the Covid-19 downturn, offering investors \u201casymmetric upside\u201d as operations normalised.\r\n \r\nImproved governance and market recognition have also served as catalysts for certain stocks.\r\n \r\nEnhancements in corporate disclosure, transparency and alignment with minority shareholders can lead to increased institutional interest, notes Tiruchelvam.\r\n \r\nHe writes: \u201cYangzijiang Financial\u2019s spin-off in 2022, which separated its investment management arm from its core shipbuilding operations, exemplifies how structural changes can strengthen governance and unlock value.\u201d\r\n \r\nFinally, index inclusion provides another avenue for re-rating, with the analyst noting that Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) enjoyed greater liquidity and valuation support following its entry into the FTSE Straits Times All-Share Index, a market capitalisation weighted index that tracks the performance of companies listed on SGX that are within the top 98% by market capitalisation.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nSembcorp wins bid to build 86 MWp floating solar farm on Pandan Reservoir\r\nThis is the group\u2019s third floating solar project in Singapore\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Sembcorp Industries : U96 0%, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sembcorp Solar Singapore, has won a bid by the Public Utilities Board to build a floating solar farm on Pandan Reservoir. \r\n \r\nUnder the project, it will build a floating solar photovoltaic (PV) system of around 86 megawatt-peak (MWp) on the reservoir, the company said on Monday (Sep 1). \r\n \r\nJen Tan, chief executive officer of Sembcorp Solar Singapore, pointed out that floating solar projects are \u201cvital for Singapore\u2019s land-scarce energy landscape\u201d. \r\n \r\nAs Sembcorp\u2019s third floating solar project in Singapore, the company said that this reinforces its position as a leading floating solar energy player in the country. \r\n \r\nIn 2021, Sembcorp completed Singapore\u2019s first large-scale inland floating solar farm at Tengeh Reservoir. The 60 MWp project was one of the largest single floating solar PV systems in the world at the time of its completion, said Sembcorp. \r\n \r\nEarlier in 2025, Sembcorp signed a 25-year renewable energy purchase agreement with Meta Platforms subsidiary Malkoha to build, own and operate a 150 MWp floating solar farm on Kranji Reservoir. \r\n \r\nAre sell-offs at Sembcorp, ST Engineering and SIA after their earnings reports a harbinger of doom?\r\nCurrently, Sembcorp has more than 1 gigawatt-peak of solar capacity and over 300 megawatt-hour of energy storage in its Singapore portfolio. \r\n \r\nGlobally, the company\u2019s renewable energy capacity stands at 18.9 gigawatts.\r\n \r\nComfortDelGro buys rest of CityCab shares for S$116.3 million from ST Engineering unit\r\nThe sale shares were valued at S$98.9 million\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Transport giant ComfortDelGro : C52 +1.38% (CDG) acquired on Monday (Sep 1) all of ST Engineering Land Systems\u2019 shares in taxi operator CityCab for a total purchase consideration of S$116.3 million. \r\n \r\nCityCab was a joint venture between CDG, which owned 53.5 per cent, and the ST Engineering : S63 -0.91% unit, which held the remaining 46.5 per cent stake. \r\n \r\nCityCab has been managed by CDG since 2005 as part of the latter\u2019s local taxi business. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the mainboard-listed company.\r\n \r\nIn a bourse filing, CDG said: \u201cFull ownership will strengthen the group\u2019s core point-to-point business in Singapore and allow the group to better integrate and shape its global point-to-point business, adapting to market demands and boosting profit contribution.\u201d\r\n \r\nIt expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive.\r\n \r\nBased on a jointly commissioned Aug 25 report by Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services, both parties agreed on a valuation of S$98.9 million for the sale shares as at Jun 1, before arriving at the final S$116.3 million figure \u2013 which has been paid in full and was funded through CDG\u2019s bank facilities.\r\n \r\nCDG noted that the net tangible asset and book value attributable to ST Engineering Land Systems\u2019 shares in CityCab is around S$37.4 million, based on the taxi operator\u2019s audited financial statements for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2024.\r\n \r\nIt added that the acquisition is not expected to have any material impact on its net tangible assets or earnings per share for its financial year ending Dec 31, 2025.\r\n \r\nFor ST Engineering, the divestment will result in cash proceeds of S$116.3 million and translates to an enterprise value or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) multiple of 5.5 times based on CityCab\u2019s unaudited Ebitda in the last 12 months for the period ended May 31, it said.\r\n \r\nThe net tangible asset value and the book value attributable to its sale shares was around S$36 million, added ST Engineering. \r\n \r\nThe group expects the divestment to result in a one-off gain on disposal of about S$77.2 million for the current financial year. \r\n \r\nST Engineering added that its share of CityCab\u2019s net profit for 2024 stood at S$8.7 million, and that the taxi operator\u2019s revenue was not consolidated into its financials since CityCab was equity accounted. \r\n \r\nThe company noted that it will use the proceeds of the sale to pay down its debt, which will result in interest expense savings of some S$4 million on an annualised basis.\r\n \r\nCityCab began in 1995 with the merger of the taxi operations of the former Singapore Bus Service and Singapore Technologies Automotive, which in 1997 merged into ST Engineering. \r\n \r\nMetaOptics eyes S$6 million in gross proceeds from IPO, to trade on SGX Catalist on Sep 9\r\nThe startup intends to introduce a new laser with a \u2018pulsing feature to enable faster, customised mould production\u2019\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Home-grown semiconductor optics startup MetaOptics intends to raise some S$6 million in gross proceeds from its initial public offering (IPO), as it issues 30 million placement shares at S$0.20 apiece. \r\n \r\nThe company said on Monday (Sep 1) that trading of its shares is expected to begin on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange on Sep 9. The placement will bring the company\u2019s outstanding shares to more than 235 million in number, translating to a market capitalisation of about S$47.2 million.\r\n \r\nThe vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of meta optics components and products on Monday registered its offer document for the proposed placement and listing of its ordinary shares. \r\n \r\nZico Capital is the sponsor, issue manager and placement agent for the IPO.\r\n \r\nMetaOptics said it is the first pure-play meta-lens company to seek a public listing. \r\n \r\nThe company, established in 2021, added that the net proceeds it is seeking to raise from the placement will amount to some S$4 million after deducting related commissions and estimated expenses.\r\n \r\nIt intends to use the proceeds primarily for product development, research and development (R&D), as well as strategic partnerships. In addition, the money will be used for business expansion, through \u201corganic growth, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and/or strategic partnerships\u201d.\r\n \r\nThe funds will also go towards working capital and general corporate purposes, said the company.\r\n \r\nOn its business strategies and future plans, MetaOptics said it intends to drive growth by focusing on miniaturising devices and integrating meta-lenses into a wider range of applications for smart devices, optical sensors, smart glasses, autonomous vehicles, as well as augmented or virtual reality displays. \r\n \r\nThe company will introduce a new laser with a \u201cpulsing feature to enable faster, customised mould production\u201d. \r\n \r\nIt added that its R&D efforts will target the \u201cdevelopment of tuneable meta-lenses and strategic collaborations with customers and overseas innovation hubs\u201d. \r\n \r\nSaid MetaOptics\u2019 executive chairman and chief executive, Mark Thng: \u201cWith secured purchase orders and increasing design wins, we believe we are well placed to capture the rapidly expanding market in smart devices, IoT (internet of things), and next-generation optical systems.\u201d\r\n \r\n\u201cLooking ahead, supported by favourable industry prospects, our trusted partners in the ecosystem as well as our proven capabilities, we are confident that MetaOptics will continue to lead in innovative, high-performance optical solutions for next-generation applications, capable of delivering sustainable growth and long-term value to our shareholders.\u201d\r\n \r\nMetaOptics is headquartered in Singapore, at the JTC LaunchPad. \r\n \r\nThe company on Jul 30 lodged its preliminary prospectus for the Catalist listing.\r\n \r\nThe Business Times earlier reported that the company posted a net loss of S$2.3 million on a revenue of S$79,440 for FY2024. This followed net losses of S$1.2 million for FY2023, and S$1.1 million for FY2022. \r\n \r\nFor the first quarter of 2025, its net loss was S$706,391. \r\n \r\nBack in May, MetaOptics was one of three companies to bag top honours at BT\u2019s inaugural Design AI and Tech Awards, a competition that aims to spur innovators to harness design and technology to develop groundbreaking solutions that tackle real-life business challenges.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding leads gains; STI up 0.2%\r\nAcross the broader market, gainers beat losers 313 to 225, after 1.4 billion securities worth S$1.3 billion change hands\r\n \r\nAcross the broader market, gainers beat losers 313 to 225, with 1.4 billion securities worth S$1.3 billion changing hands. \r\n[SINGAPORE] The local bourse started the week on a positive note, contrary to cautious sentiments in regional markets.\r\n \r\nThe Straits Times Index (STI) rose 0.2 per cent or 6.37 points to 4,276.07 on Monday (Sep 1).

Disclosures must be meaningful and relevant to investors \u2013 and AI will change how such reports are created and consumed\r\n \r\nMILESTONES are not simply markers of time. They are moments that invite reflection, to pause and acknowledge achievements with gratitude, and to look ahead with renewed perspective and determination.\r\n \r\nThis year, Singapore celebrates its 60th anniversary, a remarkable testament to six decades of resilience, unity and transformation. The Singapore Corporate Awards (SCA) marks its 20th anniversary, cementing its place as the stage on which excellence in corporate governance and reporting is recognised. Coincidentally, my own home institution, the NUS Business School, turns 60 this year as well.\r\n \r\nFor those of us reflecting on the evolution of business and governance in Singapore, 2025 is nothing short of a milestone year.\r\n \r\nSince its inception, the SCA, organised by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (Isca), the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) and The Business Times, has been synonymous with raising standards of corporate governance practices in Singapore.\r\n \r\nWithin this constellation of awards, the Best Annual Report Award (ARA) has stood as a beacon of exemplary corporate reporting. At this juncture, as the SCA turns 20, it feels fitting to reflect on how far annual reporting has come, and how the ARA has evolved over the years.\r\n \r\nTwo decades ago, annual reports were quite different creatures. The emphasis was mostly on ensuring compliance with statutory requirements.\r\n \r\nThe ARA rewarded companies that produced complete, high-quality and well-presented financial disclosures. Sustainability elements were minimal, and often relegated to side notes. Annual reports were largely static documents, designed to meet the letter of the rules rather than to tell the fuller story of the company.\r\n \r\nOver time, the focus of annual reporting shifted profoundly as expectations of investors and stakeholders began to change.\r\n \r\nAnnual reports became a window into the company: its mission, strategies, risks and, increasingly, its impact on society and the environment. Compliance gradually gave way to communication.\r\n \r\nStrategic storytelling\r\nThe best annual reports today are strategic storytelling tools that weave together a company\u2019s purpose, performance and prospects into a coherent whole. Sustainability reporting moved from the margins to the mainstream, and ESG disclosures are no longer optional extras, but core measures of corporate responsibility and long-term value creation.\r\n \r\nThe ARA has been a mirror to this transformation. From recognising those who excelled at clear financial disclosures, it now rewards those who tell a compelling, integrated story. Impact and accountability have become the heart of great reporting.\r\n \r\nThe winners of the 2025 ARA embody this shift, and exemplify the very best of what corporate reporting can achieve.\r\n \r\nIn the big-cap category (market capitalisation of S$1 billion and above), DBS Group Holdings clinched the Gold, with Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) claiming the Silver and Bronze. The winners are distinguished by their integration of corporate mission, risk assessment, financial performance and ESG strategy into a seamless narrative that not only informed, but also inspired in equal measure.\r\n \r\nIn the mid-cap category (market capitalisation of $300 million to $1 billion), SBS Transit drove home the point that operational detail and forward-looking insight can ride comfortably side by side. Its gold-winning report was clear, structured and highly readable. Far East Orchard (Silver award) and Hong Leong Asia (Bronze Award) followed with commendable efforts that kept pace with rising expectations.\r\n \r\nIn the small-cap category (market capitalisation of under $300 million), Qian Hu shone with its informative and clear report. Close behind is Banyan Tree Holdings and Hotel Royal, the latter making its debut appearance with an innovative, comprehensive effort that earned it a place on the podium.\r\n \r\nAmong Reits and Business Trusts, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust stood alone as the Gold winner, praised for its clear articulation of portfolio performance and substantive disclosures.\r\n \r\nWhile larger companies often have greater resources to produce more sophisticated reports, this year\u2019s results show that excellence is not a matter of size. Mid- and smaller-cap winners demonstrated that clarity of thought, relevance of disclosures to stakeholders and innovative presentations can be just as impactful.\r\n \r\nBeyond financial figures\r\nTo lead the pack today, it is no longer enough to simply disclose more; rather, the disclosures must be meaningful, coherent and relevant. That includes minimising boilerplate language, using visuals to clarify rather than to decorate, and maintaining a consistent voice that reflects the company\u2019s character and strategy.\r\n \r\nThe common thread observed by the ARA judging panel among all the winners was their ability to provide information that investors find useful.\r\n \r\nToday, investors and stakeholders look well beyond the financial numbers. They seek context, perspective and insight into what drives performance. They want clarity on the market environment, the risks a company faces and the strategies it employs to navigate them effectively and responsibly.\r\n \r\nForward-looking perspectives are valued as much as historical performance, and transparency is expected, not only in celebrating successes but also in acknowledging setbacks and challenges. For companies, meeting these expectations brings tangible benefits, from strengthening investor confidence to deepening stakeholder trust.\r\n \r\nBut milestones are not only about looking back, they are also about charting the way forward.\r\n \r\nIn his recent SG60 National Day message, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reminded us that progress depends on drawing strength from the past while pressing forward with confidence.\r\n \r\nAt these crossroads, the question naturally arises: where is annual reporting heading? Yet, perhaps the more critical question is not merely one of direction, but of aspiration. What should we, as a business community, envision annual reporting becoming?\r\n \r\nThe answer is already beginning to take shape.\r\n \r\nESG will and should remain at the forefront. The focus, however, is shifting from broad intentions to measurable impact.\r\n \r\nInvestors and stakeholders increasingly expect quantified results tied directly to corporate strategy and financial performance. Global standards set by, for example, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) will help ensure comparability, while external assurance on sustainability data will likely become the norm rather than the exception, cementing credibility.\r\n \r\nSustainability should not appear as a detached insert; it should be woven seamlessly into the fabric of the company\u2019s story, so that readers are not left burdened with piecing together two separate reports.\r\n \r\nStatic, text-heavy PDF reports will increasingly give way to digital-first formats that are more interactive, visual and engaging. Reports of the future will be living documents, rich with user-friendly visualisation and dashboards that enable stakeholders to explore trends and performance with greater ease and depth.\r\n \r\nThe most compelling reports will be those that connect strategy, risk, financials and ESG into one coherent story that informs decisions.\r\n \r\nOn to the next milestones\r\nLooking ahead, artificial intelligence (AI) will almost certainly reshape how annual reports are created and consumed. As AI capabilities expand, so too will the demand for real-time reporting.\r\n \r\nFor companies, AI tools can streamline production, detect inconsistencies, enhance data visualisation and generate timely updates. For readers, AI offers more dynamic and personalised experiences, so users can query the information in real time and receive tailored, evidence-based responses specific to their needs.\r\n \r\nThese possibilities are exciting and will open new avenues of engagement, but they will also bring new responsibilities. Ensuring that AI-generated content remains accurate, authentic, and aligned with reporting standards will be critical.\r\n \r\nAs Nelson Mandela once said: \u201cRemember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead.\u201d\r\n \r\nSingapore\u2019s 60 years of dynamic nation-building, the SCA\u2019s 20 years of recognising excellence, and the ARA\u2019s journey from past to present all remind us that progress is built on the foundations of yesterday, but sustained by the choices we make today for tomorrow. The challenge now is to keep evolving.\r\n \r\nAnnual reports must continue to innovate, embrace technology with responsibility, and integrate financial and non-financial performance into a single compelling narrative. Above all, they must remain grounded in transparency, because trust is the currency on which long-term value is built.\r\n \r\nMilestones are not end points, but markers along the road. As we celebrate the ARA winners of 2025, we do so with the knowledge that the next chapter will demand even more.\r\n \r\nThe future of annual reporting will belong to those who can combine the rigour of transparency and accuracy with the art of storytelling, who can harness technology while preserving the irreplaceable human touch, and who understand that excellence is not a destination, but a continuous journey.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nRents for privately held HDB shops double in past year; prices hold steady for those leased from HDB\r\nThe rising rents are squeezing some shops in the HDB heartland, leading them to relocate, downsize or close altogether\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Rental rates have more than doubled for privately held HDB shop units, particularly over the past year, while rents for shops directly leased out by HDB have mostly held steady.\r\n \r\nMedian rentals for heartland shops held by private landlords rose from $3.51 per sq ft (psf) in the second quarter of 2024 to S$7.34 psf in the second quarter of 2025.\r\n \r\nThis is the highest ever rental rate for privately held HDB shops, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority\u2019s (URA) Realis data that dates back to 1999. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, shops directly rented out by HDB have seen rents rise at a more gradual rate.\r\n \r\nHDB said rents for nine in 10 of such shops have remained largely unchanged over the past five years.\r\n \r\nProperty analysts and agents attributed the rise in rental rates for privately held HDB shops to increased demand for such units after consumer sentiment improved post-pandemic, even though there are signs that this demand is now moderating.\r\n \r\nHDB shop units can either be rented from private owners or the state. The Housing Board said there are about 8,500 privately held HDB shops, while the remaining 7,000 shop units are directly rented out by the government. \r\n \r\nIn 1998, the government stopped selling HDB shop units to private owners, and the board now rents them out directly.\r\n \r\nHDB said this gives it the \u201cflexibility to better curate the trade mix of shops\u201d and respond to residents\u2019 needs. \r\n \r\nThe rising rents are squeezing some shops in the HDB heartland, leading them to relocate, downsize or close altogether.\r\n \r\nCoping with rising private rentals\r\nTo cope, some business owners have been subletting a part of their HDB shops.\r\n \r\nFor instance, Ken Seng Guan\u2019s bakery chain carved out a roughly 250 sq ft space from its 600 sq ft Pek Kio outlet and has sublet it to various shops over the 10 years it has operated the space \u2013 from a bubble tea store to a stationery shop, and now, a hair salon.\r\n \r\nThe Bakery Cuisine director said his rent \u2013 currently S$12,000 \u2013 has gone up by about 40 per cent over the past decade, or about 10 per cent every three years.\r\n \r\nThe roughly S$3,800 in monthly income from subletting has helped Bakery Cuisine continue running the privately held Pek Kio store despite rising overheads, said Ken.\r\n \r\nKen\u2019s business also sublets some of its HDB-owned shops in Punggol and Pasir Ris, where rentals have hovered around S$4,000 to S$5,000 over the 10 to 20 years he has run them.\r\n \r\nWhile rents for his HDB-owned stores have held steady, Ken said he continues renting from private landlords because these stores \u2013 built before 1998 \u2013 tend to be near town centres, where footfall is higher.\r\n \r\nThere is no available data on how many tenants of privately held HDB shops sublet their units.\r\n \r\nAbout 4 per cent of the 7,000 shops rented out by HDB are subletting their units, the board said. This excludes about 500 coffee shops, markets and market-produce shops.\r\n \r\nOther businesses said they have had to downsize to smaller units.\r\n \r\nIn March 2024, mobile phone retailer Erajaya moved from its 500 sq ft unit in the atrium area of HDB Hub in Toa Payoh to a smaller 300 sq ft unit in a nearby block, after its private landlord asked for a 20 per cent to 30 per cent increase in rent. The business was paying about S$28,000 a month.\r\n \r\nJeff Ho, the store\u2019s operations manager until early August, said the hike would have been unsustainable.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe are just getting by. Our margins are small given the high rental,\u201d said the 45-year-old.\r\n \r\nCommuters passing by Singtel mobile phone retailer Erajaya\u2019s shop in a row of HDB retail units at the foot of Block 190 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh during the evening rush hour on Jun 19. PHOTO: MARK CHEONG, ST\r\nHe added that rent for its current shop at Block 190 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh is about 20 per cent lower, but the trade-off is having less room to display products and serve customers.\r\n \r\nRetailers in the same row of shops as Erajaya said at least five shops there have shuttered or downsized in the past year because of rental hikes and poor business.\r\n \r\nAccording to Realis data, median rents for privately held HDB shops in Toa Payoh rose by 58.6 per cent from S$4.91 psf in the fourth quarter of 2024 to S$7.70 psf in the second quarter of 2025.\r\n \r\nEven though rents for privately held HDB shops may be more volatile, property agents told The Straits Times many businesses still opt to lease from private landlords as their shops are located in older estates built before 1998.\r\n \r\nPrivately held HDB shops can also be rented out to any business, as long as they are on HDB\u2019s list of allowable trades.\r\n \r\nIn comparison, units rented out by HDB are bound to specific trades under the tenancy agreement \u2013 for example, a unit that HDB has marked out for a medical facility cannot be rented out to a cafe owner.\r\n \r\nThe supply of privately held HDB shops that the government stopped selling in 1998 is expected to become tighter because these units typically have 30-year leases, said Nicholas Mak, chief research officer at property search portal  <https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=9ac683f1-fe6d2c51-9ac236c7-3cecefeaf2ae-51a0fb5c89932bdc&q=1&e=1484d211-6cd4-420c-960c-be3e5e2f6097&u=http%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg.\r\n \r\nThis means the lease for the last HDB sold shop with a 30-year lease could expire in 2028, he said.\r\n \r\n\u201cGoing forward, the government will be the main landlord of HDB shop units. Hence, it will be up to the government to manage the rental costs of tenants in state-owned HDB shop units,\u201d said Mak.\r\n \r\nHDB had in 2022 extended the leases for some 730 privately held HDB shops with expiring tenancies by at least a year. During the extension, they could make new business plans or bid for a new tenancy.\r\n \r\nSteady rents for those renting from HDB\r\nMeanwhile, businesses that rent from the government said rents have held mostly steady.\r\n \r\nData provided by HDB showed that the average rent for medical facilities rose to S$8.71 psf in 2024, up 13 per cent from S$7.68 psf in 2020.\r\n \r\nThe average rent for food and beverage shops was S$7.66 psf in 2020, compared with S$8.12 psf in 2024, while those for essential services \u2013 minimarts, provision shops and supermarkets \u2013 went from S$5.15 psf in 2020 to S$5.36 psf in 2024.\r\n \r\nUnlike URA\u2019s Realis, which gives rental data for privately held HDB shops in median values \u2013 the middle point when rents are arranged from lowest to highest \u2013 HDB provides rental data using average values. This is calculated by taking the mean of all the rents.\r\n \r\nDarren Tan, who runs bakery chain iCakes, said stable rental is a major perk of leasing a shop in Buangkok from HDB, for which he pays about S$5,000 a month in rent.\r\n \r\nThe 35-year-old said rent for the roughly 500 sq ft unit had increased by about 10 per cent over the seven years he has operated it, which he said was reasonable for a mature estate.\r\n \r\nMobile phone retailer Yeo Siew Ngee said rental for a 150 sq ft shop he leases from HDB in Toa Payoh has been more reasonable than what private landlords are charging him for another two shops of the same size in the area.\r\n \r\nHe said HDB has increased the rent by about 5 to 10 per cent in the decade that he has operated the store, whereas private landlords have raised rentals by 20 to 30 per cent over the same period.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe rent increases for my HDB shop are minimal, and that has helped me to sustain the business. For my other two stores, I have to sublet a part of the space to make sure we can afford the rent,\u201d said Yeo, 51, who declined to give specific figures.\r\n \r\nBut some business owners said HDB-owned shop units can be difficult to secure because of high bids.\r\n \r\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician Tan Yuan Ming said he was edged out of a public tender for an HDB retail unit in Sengkang in March by bids that were twice his own.\r\n \r\nTan made a bid of S$4,700 for the 527 sq ft unit, but saw that successive bids on HDB\u2019s online bidding portal hit five-figure sums.\r\n \r\nThe unit at Block 279 Sengkang East Avenue was awarded to Q & M Dental Centre, which had placed a S$14,000 bid. There were 21 bidders for the unit, who submitted bids ranging from S$3,850 to S$14,000.\r\n \r\nTan, 32, has since 2023 been looking for a retail unit to grow his business The TCM Folks, a mobile TCM clinic he founded in 2022. It currently makes house calls as it does not have a brick-and-mortar space.\r\n \r\n\u201cI\u2019d thought it\u2019d be cheaper to rent a shop from HDB, but it turned out that the bids still went way above what we can stomach as a small business,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\nThat said, property agents said there are signs that rents for HDB shops are cooling. They attributed this to an uncertain economic outlook, which has spooked businessmen from opening new stores.\r\n \r\nBusiness owners are also more cautious about committing to high rents, causing rental growth to moderate slightly in 2025, said ERA property agent Patrick Poh.\r\n \r\nWith businesses also facing greater cost pressures \u2013 from manpower to utilities \u2013 landlords are also becoming slightly more flexible in rental negotiations, Poh added.\r\n \r\nAlex Wong from PropNex Realty said: \u201cIn 2024, it was more of a landlord\u2019s market, when the sentiment among businesses was bullish.\r\n \r\n\u201cToday, it\u2019s become more of a tenant\u2019s market, as inquiries have dropped and landlords seem more willing to negotiate offers that do not meet their asking prices.\u201d \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nMarina Bay Sands\u2019 scale, success and bold expansion are a blessing and a curse for Singapore\u2019s hotel sector\r\nThe integrated resort is outperforming the industry and its expansion will augment its leading position\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] The picture for Singapore\u2019s hotel sector in the second quarter was not pretty. However, the sector\u2019s performance in July showed improvement from the year-ago period. \r\n \r\nIn Q2 2025, the Republic\u2019s hotels posted an average room rate (ARR) of S$263.83, down 1.1 per cent from the year-ago period\u2019s S$266.89, according to Singapore Tourism Board (STB) data.\r\n \r\nAverage occupancy rate for hotels here slipped from 78.2 per cent in Q2 2024 to 77.8 per cent in the second quarter. As such, revenue per available room (RevPAR) fell 1.7 per cent to S$205.15 in Q2 2025, from S$208.77 in Q2 2024.\r\n \r\nOn the supply front, there were 5.9 million available room nights in Q2 2025, up 2.4 per cent from the year-ago quarter.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, on the demand side, observers noted that the US-tariff-related uncertainty may have led to delayed or cancelled travel plans and muted the willingness of business and leisure travellers to spend. Furthermore, the strong Singapore dollar did not help.\r\n \r\nUnsurprisingly, listed trusts which are major owners of hotels here, such as CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 +1.89% and Far East Hospitality Trust, : Q5T +0.85% posted weaker financial performance \u2013 both trusts declared substantially lower distribution per stapled security for H1 2025 compared with H1 2024.\r\n \r\nHowever, STB\u2019s data showed ARR, average occupancy rate and RevPAR of Singapore\u2019s hotels rose year on year (yoy) in July 2025, with RevPAR at S$250.78, up 3.8 per cent yoy. \r\n \r\nMBS\u2019 performance\r\nNonetheless, even as the hotel sector faces uncertainties, integrated resort Marina Bay Sands (MBS), which fronts Marina Bay, is powering ahead.\r\n \r\nFor the quarter ended June, MBS\u2019 owner New York-listed Las Vegas Sands (LVS) reported that MBS\u2019 ARR for Q2 2025 grew to US$888 from US$797 in Q2 2024, up 11.4 per cent yoy. \r\n \r\nIn Q2 2025, MBS\u2019 occupancy was 95 per cent, versus 95.3 per cent in the year-ago quarter. \r\n \r\nThus, MBS\u2019 second quarter RevPAR climbed 11.2 per cent yoy to US$844.  \r\n \r\nMBS is outperforming the luxury tier of Singapore hotels. According to STB data, for the months of April to June, the ARR of the luxury tier of hotels ranged from S$630.64 to S$648.11 while occupancy rate was between 76.25 per cent and 78.99 per cent.  \r\n \r\nPerhaps, MBS\u2019 strong performance is due to its scale and unique offering.\r\n \r\nToday, MBS has 775 suites and 1,069 rooms. In each of the last four years, MBS employed over 10,000 full-time employees.\r\n \r\nThe integrated resort\u2019s retail offering \u2013 The Shoppes at MBS \u2013 has a sizeable 620,513 sq ft of gross lettable area and hosts numerous flagship stores of major brands. \r\n \r\nMBS is central to the meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (Mice) business in Singapore. There are over 300,000 sq ft of exhibition halls at Sands Convention and Exhibition Centre. Also, MBS has 21 ballrooms of varying sizes, including the largest, the Sands Grand Ballroom, which can accommodate up to 8,000 guests.\r\n \r\nAdd to all of the above, centrally located MBS boasts great dining spots, the Republic\u2019s largest nightclub Marquee, a casino, a skypark with the world\u2019s longest infinity pool, an ArtScience Museum and iconic architecture.\r\n \r\nMBS shines not just in Singapore\u2019s tourism scene but also relative to LVS\u2019 Macau operations. According to  its latest earnings presentation, LVS has five integrated resorts with about 10,800 rooms and suites in Macau.\r\n \r\nFor Q2 2025, LVS reported that MBS\u2019 adjusted property earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) was US$768 million while that of Macau operations was US$566 million. Adjusted property Ebitda margin of MBS was 55.3 per cent versus 31.5 per cent for Macau operations.  \r\n \r\nMBS\u2019 expansion\r\nGiven MBS\u2019 success, LVS can confidently embark on major expansion plans for MBS, despite geopolitical tensions and US\u2019 trade tariffs affecting the economic growth outlook globally and in Singapore.\r\n \r\nIn May, piling and foundation work commenced on MBS\u2019 US$8 billion expansion project, with construction estimated to be completed in mid-2030. \r\n \r\nThe project will introduce a new 570-suite hotel, a 15,000-seat arena, additional Mice capacity and entertainment offerings including premium gaming areas.\r\n \r\nCertainly, MBS has contributed enormously to Singapore\u2019s economic growth and her appeal as an exciting global city.\r\n \r\nMBS has created many jobs as well as sourcing and procurement opportunities for Singapore-based small and medium enterprises. \r\n \r\nThe integrated resort\u2019s expansion project can help to substantially strengthen the city-state\u2019s appeal to luxury travellers, as a key Mice destination and as a leading venue for global entertainment events among others.\r\n \r\nFor sure, MBS\u2019 success has generated some tailwinds for Singapore\u2019s hospitality sector. And MBS\u2019 expansion project could further benefit other hotels here.  \r\n \r\nThink of how MBS draws more leisure visitors here, with many of these visitors visiting the integrated resort but staying elsewhere in the city-state. Or how MBS hosts Mice events that attract international visitors who stay at accommodation islandwide.\r\n \r\nImagine too how the new 15,000-seat arena could host top live musical performances which draw visitors from the region, thus driving demand for the entire hotel sector here. \r\n \r\nHowever, MBS is grabbing significant market share, be it in the high-end hotel, luxury retail, premier dining or nightlife segments, which can hurt other owners of properties targeting these segments.\r\n \r\nFor example, sought-after luxury leisure travellers to Singapore might choose to stay at MBS despite MBS\u2019 room rates being higher than numerous top-tier hotels because of its unique offerings and resist swapping staying at the integrated resort for what may be inferior substitutes.\r\n \r\nWith MBS being big and successful, and growing even bigger, expect it to hog talent in the Republic\u2019s hospitality industry, which faces manpower challenges as many locals may shun working in an industry where hours can be long and working nights and on weekends could be required.    \r\n \r\nGiven its scale, MBS is well-placed to offer employees better perks, training and career development opportunities relative to other smaller hotels here. Indeed, the integrated resort is widely recognised as an employer of choice.\r\n \r\nUltimately, Singapore gains from MBS flourishing and growing. However, while this giant brings some business to the wider hotel sector here, it also makes the going much tougher for other top-tier hotels in attracting demand for rooms, dining outlets and events.   \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nGuangzhou Knowledge City a useful test bed for developing new technologies: DPM Gan, Guangdong governor\r\nThe deputy prime minister is also visiting Shenzhen and Beijing during his five-day trip\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] The China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City (CSGKC) is a useful test bed for the development of new technologies and will continue to support knowledge-sharing, leaders of the two regions said on Monday (Sep 1).\r\n \r\nSingapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said this in a statement after Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Gan Kim Yong visited the CSGKC, a state-level bilateral project that marks its 15th anniversary this year. While in Guangzhou, he met Guangdong Governor Wang Weizhong, who also hosted him to lunch.\r\n \r\nDPM Gan\u2019s trip to the 232 square kilometre township was the first stop in his five-day working visit to China that began on Sunday.\r\n \r\nOn Monday, he visited the National University of Singapore Guangzhou Research Translation and Innovation Institute, the DBS Global Fintech R&D Centre, and agritech startup Singrow.\r\n \r\nThese are among the more than 50 Singapore companies currently based in CSGKC, which has served as a key landing pad for them to access the Greater Bay Area.\r\nIn its statement, MFA said that DPM Gan and Wang reaffirmed the strong economic collaboration and longstanding people-to-people ties between Singapore and Guangdong.\r\n \r\nGuangdong has been Singapore\u2019s top provincial trading partner in China for the last 36 consecutive years, noted MFA. \u201cBeyond trade, our robust cooperation has expanded to a wide range of sectors, including advanced manufacturing, digital economy, intellectual property rights protection, education and healthcare,\u201d the ministry added.\r\n \r\nApart from Guangzhou, DPM Gan is also visiting Shenzhen and Beijing. On Wednesday, he will attend a series of commemorative events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.\r\n \r\nThis is his first visit to China since becoming DPM.

But set against the broader market and compared to valuations, the picture is less rosy.   \r\n \r\nData crunched by property listing platform PropertyGuru for The Business Times indicates that median asking prices of HDB flats built in the 1960s held steady in the past year, up 1.6 per cent to S$375,000. \r\n \r\nERA key executive officer Eugene Lim said many of these old flats in sought-after mature estates witnessed substantial price growth in the last five years despite their age, in tandem with the overall resale market. \r\n \r\nIn the first seven months of 2025, the median price of three-room flats built in the 1960s ranged from S$335,000 to S$380,000 \u2013 up by between 30 per cent and 60 per cent compared to their median in 2020 at between S$220,000 and S$275,000. That of two-room flats likewise rose from S$188,000-S$207,000 in 2020, to S$285,000-S$301,888 in 2025. \r\n \r\nOld four-room flats in Queenstown even hit a median price of S$899,000 in 2025, though Lim noted that the transactions were for terraced houses, which are rare and tend to draw high prices. \r\n \r\nSet against a longer time frame, gains shrink. Huttons Asia senior director of data analytics Lee Sze Teck pointed out that compared to 2013, prices of the oldest two-room and three-room flats are 5.8 to 5.9 per cent higher today.  \r\n \r\nIn comparison, prices of two-room flats built in the 1970s rose by 15.5 per cent between 2013 and 2025, and that of three-room flats by 12.4 per cent. \r\n \r\nLee Nai Jia, PropertyGuru head of real estate intelligence, data and software solutions, noted that the 1.6 per cent rise in asking prices for the 60s era flats is modest compared to the 10.3 per cent increase observed in the broader resale market. \r\n \r\nNicholas Mak, chief research officer at property portal  <https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=f6cc0ec3-9267a163-f6c8bbf5-3cecefeaf2ae-3b3844e623305b15&q=1&e=1484d211-6cd4-420c-960c-be3e5e2f6097&u=http%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg, pointed to a mismatch between sellers\u2019 expectations and valuations of these old HDBs. \r\n \r\nFigures from  <https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=b77fe1f4-d3d44e54-b77b54c2-3cecefeaf2ae-bdb262d9b2d330fb&q=1&e=1484d211-6cd4-420c-960c-be3e5e2f6097&u=http%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg showed that the median asking price of 1960s HDB flats ranged from S$309,000 to S$1.75 million this year, with the lowest for two-room flats and the highest for terraced houses. The median asking price of three-room flats, which comprised the bulk of listings on the portal, was S$388,888. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, median valuations ranged between S$316,000 and S$847,000 for these flats. \r\n \r\n\u201cThis suggests that two-room flats may be underpriced on the market, whereas five-room flats and terraced houses appear to be overpriced,\u201d said Mak. Three-room flats, in particular, had a median valuation of S$336,000, which was far below their median asking price of S$388,888. \r\n \r\nLee from PropertyGuru said demand for 60s era flats has been trending downwards. \r\n \r\nAccording to the platform\u2019s data, impressions \u2013 or views \u2013 on resale listings for the oldest flats fell about 28 per cent year on year, a sharp drop compared to the overall resale market.  \r\n \r\nAs the government ramps up new public housing supply, Lee reckoned that demand for these older flats will only continue to dwindle, potentially placing downward pressure on prices. \r\n \r\nERA\u2019s Lim noted that transaction activity for these older flats has remained fairly stable in the past decade, ranging from 219 to 300 units a year. On average, 263 homes built in the 1960s change hands annually. \r\n \r\nIn the first seven months of 2025, 170 units were sold \u2013 tracking within historical norms. \r\n \r\nFewer transactions does not necessarily reflect weaker demand, and could be due to a limited supply of flats for sale, said Lim. \r\n \r\nOn the rental front, Lee from PropertyGuru said listing impressions generally tracked the overall HDB rental trend. \r\n \r\n\u201cWhile rental demand saw a decline from 2023 to 2024, it appears to have stabilised in 2025,\u201d said Lee. Listings were typically room rentals, with average asking rent of around S$1,100 per month as at July 2025. \r\n \r\nCashing out\r\n \r\nSeniors seeking more immediate ways to monetise their homes can turn to HDB\u2019s lease buyback scheme (LBS). \r\n \r\nUnder the scheme, eligible seniors can sell part of their flat\u2019s remaining lease to HDB, with proceeds topping up their CPF Retirement Account and purchasing a CPF Life plan, which provides monthly payouts for life. Any excess will be returned to them in cash, \r\n \r\nAs at Dec 31, 2024, 13,734 households have taken up LBS. Of these, about 52 per cent lived in three-room or smaller flats, around 34 per cent lived in four-room flats, and the remaining 14 per cent in five-room or bigger flats. \r\n \r\nThe vast majority of households at 90 per cent retain lease lengths of 20 to 30 years, said HDB, allowing seniors to \u201csupplement their retirement income while ageing\u201d. The remaining households were evenly split between 15-year and 35-year leases.\r\n \r\nHDB added that after selling part of their remaining leases to HDB, around nine in 10 households received proceeds of between S$100,000 and S$300,000. \r\n \r\nThis value is before the top-up to their CPF retirement account, and depends on the market value of the flats and duration of the lease retained, it said. \r\n \r\nSeniors can also receive a cash bonus when they right-size to a smaller public housing flat with the silver housing bonus. As at Dec 2024, 2,535 households have benefitted from the bonus. \r\n \r\nAgeing flats, shrinking value\r\nFigures from ERA indicated that there are 299 HDB blocks built in the 1960s, with 24,428 units in total. Most are concentrated in Queenstown, Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah and Geylang, with smaller clusters in Kallang Whampoa and the Central area. \r\n \r\nOne of the government\u2019s objectives when it launched the public housing programme in the 1960s was to ease overcrowding in the city centre by providing affordable flats in the city fringe area, Mak said. \r\n \r\nMost of these 60s-era flats are three-room and four-room flats, statistics from  <https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=f7dc303f-93779f9f-f7d88509-3cecefeaf2ae-f7268b3f006b3b38&q=1&e=1484d211-6cd4-420c-960c-be3e5e2f6097&u=http%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg showed. \r\n \r\nAnalysts expect these ageing flats to follow the trajectory observed in older private leasehold homes. \r\n \r\nAccording to Huttons\u2019 Lee, prices of 60-year leasehold terraced houses at Lorong 3 Geylang tapered off sharply as their leases came to an end. \r\n \r\nIn 2013, units transacted for over S$200,000. This fell to just over S$150,000 in 2014, equivalent to annual rent of S$33,000; declining further to over S$100,000 in 2015, equivalent to annual rent of S$30,000; before dropping to around S$50,000 in 2017 and 2018, equivalent to annual rent of S$25,000. \r\n \r\nThe land occupied by these houses returned to the state when their leases expired on Dec 31, 2020. \r\n \r\nSingapore attempted to address issues related to rebuilding ageing housing estates with the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (Sers), launched in 1995. \r\n \r\nUnder the compulsory scheme, old HDB blocks were demolished and rebuilt. Homeowners were compensated based on market value and given the option to buy a replacement flat nearby with a fresh 99-year lease. \r\n \r\nIn 2022, households in Ang Mo Kio whose flats were picked for Sers received compensation of up to S$450,000. Those flats were completed in 1979 and were about 43 years old then.\r\n \r\nOn top of that, flat owners received a grant of S$30,000, a removal allowance of S$10,000, and payment of stamp and legal fees for the purchase of a replacement flat equivalent in value to their Sers flat.\r\n \r\nMak said the \u201cattractive terms\u201d led some buyers to pay \u201ctop dollar\u201d for flats aged 40 years or more, in hopes of being picked for Sers. \r\n \r\n\u201c(It) cultivated the mindset among HDB resale flat buyers that Sers is some sort of safety net for owners of older flats,\u201d he said, \u201ca kind of government bailout for owners of ageing flats\u201d.  \r\n \r\nThis fuelled price growth of these older flats, said Mak. \u201cHowever, Sers is an expensive exercise for the government, and with the growing number of ageing flats, it is unsustainable in the long run.\u201d \r\n \r\nEarlier in August, Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat said the government does not plan to continue Sers, but instead will focus on a voluntary early redevelopment scheme (Vers), first surfaced in 2018.  \r\n \r\nAnalysts said this could prove tricky. If the scheme mirrors private collective sales, it may be difficult to secure the 80 per cent consent required from owners, with thorny questions over how to handle those who refuse. \r\n \r\nResidents who collectively decide not to proceed with it may live in their flats until the leases run out, Chee said. \u201cThe government will support them in other ways to keep their flats and their estates liveable and vibrant.\u201d\r\n \r\nCompensation is another sticking point. \r\n \r\nValuations are expected to be guided by market benchmarks, but leasehold values fall steeply as leases run down. Lee from Huttons cites the leasehold table informally known as Bala\u2019s Curve in real estate circles. \r\n \r\nBased on the table, the value of land with 30 years remaining is 60 per cent of the freehold value, said Lee. This plunges to 30 per cent when only 10 years remain. \r\n \r\nOlder flat owners may not want to move or sell if it means having to get in line for a new Build-to-Order flat, or pay for a higher-priced resale flat. \u201cThe level of interest may be lukewarm, and prices may remain relatively flat during this period of uncertainty,\u201d said Lee. \r\n \r\nVers could still appeal to those seeking a more affordable home with \u201ca potential safety net\u201d, said PropertyGuru\u2019s Lee. \u201cOver time, Vers may help stabilise demand for older flats and offer a monetisation option for households who may need it.\u201d\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nPrive group put up for sale more than a year before closure; no takers in tough market\r\nThe F&B group tried all options to stay in business to no avail, says group chairman Yuan Oeij\r\n \r\nTHE Prive group, which suddenly announced the closure of all its restaurants on Monday (Sep 1), had been on the market for over a year but failed to find any takers in a troubled F&B industry.\r\n \r\nGroup chairman Yuan Oeij said: \u201cWe (did) our best to ensure the continuity of our business and speak with interested parties \u2013 whether investors or partners \u2013 to explore different options.\r\n \r\n\u201cHowever, given the extremely tough climate for the F&B industry, everyone has been taking a very cautious stance.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe Business Times understands that the group was put up for sale in March 2024 at an asking price of S$20 million. At the time, it had 12 Prive outlets and two restaurants \u2013 Empress and Prive Grill. But by the start of 2025, the business had dwindled to six Prive outlets and the two restaurants.\r\n \r\nOeij noted that business had started to slow down considerably since the end of 2023, \u201cand just got worse each subsequent year\u201d. The business was plagued by the same issues affecting the industry: manpower, high rentals and rising food costs, compounded by a drop in traffic due to increased competition, overseas travel and changing spending patterns as customers cut back on their expenditure. \r\n \r\n\u201cSince 2024, we have been consolidating our operations, closing the non-profitable outlets, as well as reducing overheads. However, the combination of external market challenges and rising operational costs eventually left us with no viable path forward,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\nHe clarified that Commonwealth Concepts (CWC) \u2013 which is taking over the Chinese restaurant Empress and Prive ACM at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) \u2013 was not buying the outlets, \u201cbut taking over the operations to ensure continuity, which allows jobs to be preserved and for prior event bookings to be fulfilled without disruption\u201d. Oeij added that he was glad to be able to work with ACM to come to this arrangement.\r\n \r\nThe group shared the news of its closure on social media, acknowledging the difficult decision.  It also announced that Empress would continue to operate as usual, and that Prive ACM would be converted to a Baker & Cook outlet, which would open on Sep 4. \r\n \r\nBaker & Cook is just one of several F&B brands owned by CWC \u2013 a joint venture between Commonwealth Capital and Far East Organization\u2019s Refinery Concepts. Its other brands include Marmalade Pantry, Bedrock Bar & Grill, Kinki and Pastamania.\r\n \r\nThe Prive Group was established in 2007, with its first outlet at Keppel Bay. At its peak, it operated several nightclubs such as the now-defunct Stereolab and Mink at Pan Pacific Singapore. It then went on to focus on building the Prive brand with its casual cafe food and vegan menu options.\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nPrive Group closes all its restaurants; Far East\u2019s Commonwealth Concepts takes over 2 outlets\r\nThe group will be appointing a professional independent financial adviser\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] The Prive Group has shut down all its restaurants from Aug 31.\r\n \r\nIn a message to its suppliers seen by The Business Times, the Prive Group said that two of their establishments, Chinese restaurant Empress and Prive ACM located at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), will be taken over by Commonwealth Concepts (CWC) and Baker & Cook, respectively, with effect from Sep 1.\r\n \r\nIt also said that Prive will be appointing a professional independent financial adviser.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe understand they will be reaching out to suppliers directly,\u201d Prive said.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe hope you will give them the strong support that you have given us all these years with minimal disruption,\u201d the group added.\r\n \r\nThe group was besieged by a string of restaurant closures before this development. Its 313 Somerset Prive outlet was repossessed by its landlord Lendlease in early 2025, and other Prive outlets at Jewel Changi Airport, Paragon, Kent Ridge, Chijmes, Katong, Tiong Bahru, Robertson Quay and Keppel Bay  also shut down earlier.\r\n \r\nPrior to the company\u2019s closure, the remaining operating outlets were at Holland Village, Botanic Gardens and Wheelock Place. \r\n \r\nCWC was formed in 2021 through a joint venture with Singapore-based investment company Commonwealth Capital and Far East Organization\u2019s food and beverage arm, Refinery Concepts. CWC owns 12 brands, including Baker & Cook as well as Fat Cow and Bedrock Bar & Grill.\r\n \r\nBrian Stampe, chief operating officer of CWC, said: \u201cIn collaboration with ACM, CWC has been handed over operations of the Empress and former Prive ACM units.\u201d\r\n \r\n\u201cWe will continue to fulfil the prior event bookings made with Empress, as well as Prive ACM. We would like to assure everyone that there will be no disruptions in service,\u201d he added.\r\n \r\nCWC is not involved with other Prive locations outside of ACM and the former Prive unit at ACM will be converted into a Baker & Cook outlet and will reopen on Sep 4, Stampe said. \r\n \r\nThere has been a slew of food and beverage businesses shutting down in Singapore in the past few years as the number of closures hit a 20-year high in 2024.\r\n \r\nThere were 3,047 F&B business closures last year, and the average monthly closures in the first quarter of this year are above 300. \r\n \r\nThe closures include several well-known brands such as American chain Eggslut, which closed its last outlet in Singapore in early 2025, and Haidilao, which shuttered three restaurants in Bedok, Pasir Ris and Punngol. Burger & Lobster, the London-based chain, has also ceased Singapore operations.\r\n \r\nLocal restaurants such as Superfood Kitchen and popular Muslim-owned omakase restaurant The Social Outcast have also shut down, citing rising operating costs, challenging business environments, and the lack of manpower for their closure.\r\n \r\nMediacorp lays off 93 staff due to rapid scale and pace of change in media landscape\r\nThe organisation-wide cuts amount to slightly over 3% of its workforce\r\n \r\n[SINGAPORE] Mediacorp is laying off 93 staff as it adapts to a \u201crapidly evolving media landscape and to better align its operations amid the prevailing economic and commercial uncertainty\u201d. \r\n \r\nThe cuts amount to slightly over 3 per cent of its workforce, the national media organisation said in a press statement on Monday (Sep 1). It did not specify what departments are affected but said the retrenchment was organisation-wide.\r\n \r\n\u201cOver the past few years, the media environment has undergone rapid and fundamental transformation,\u201d said the company. \u201cShort-form, mobile-first, and social-driven formats are becoming dominant, while traditional long-form content and platforms face growing pressure to compete for audience attention and commercial revenue.\u201d\r\n \r\nMediacorp also cited complexity from global macroeconomic pressures such as inflation, trade disruptions and general volatility as reasons behind the manpower redundancies.\r\n \r\nThe company said it has made efforts to keep pace with the changing media consumption environment while trying to preserve jobs, but the \u201cscale and pace\u201d of change has necessitated cuts.\r\n \r\nMediacorp brands include CNA, Channel 5 and mewatch.\r\n \r\nChief executive officer Tham Loke Kheng said the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d was not taken lightly.\r\n \r\nAffected staff will have until the end of September to find other roles within Mediacorp. If unable to do so, they will receive a severance payment of one month per year of service, up to 25 months or S$250,000 depending on experience, salary and seniority. \r\n \r\nThey will also receive a training grant aimed at skills upgrades and preparation for future opportunities. \r\n \r\nThe Singapore Union of Broadcasting Employees said in a statement that it is ready to support affected staff. \u201cWe understand that the media industry is undergoing significant changes, driven by technological advancements and evolving audience content habits.\u201d \r\n \r\nIndonesia government says economic fundamentals solid despite protests, vows to defend rupiah\r\n \r\nJAKARTA - Indonesia\u2019s financial and economic regulators on Sept 1 said economic fundamentals were strong, after widespread political protests sparked selling of stocks and the currency.\r\n \r\nThe main stock index tumbled more than 3 per cent in opening trades before regaining some of the losses.\r\n \r\nThe rupiah, which fell 0.9 per cent against the US dollar on Aug 29 as the protests escalated, firmed slightly on Sept 1 after the central bank vowed to defend the currency.\r\n \r\nAhead of the market open, the central bank\u2019s head of monetary management Erwin Gunawan Hutapea said Bank Indonesia would guard the rupiah to ensure its movement reflected fundamentals, including through currency intervention.\r\n \r\nThe rupiah was little changed at 12,837 to the Singapore dollar as at noon on Sept 1, after weakening about 1.2 per cent in the past week.\r\n \r\nChief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the economy was fundamentally solid and would get a boost from a planned incentive package, promising to \u201cminimise the impact\u201d on the economy of the protests, in which at least eight people have died.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe hope for a peaceful and respectful situation that will support economic recovery,\u201d Mr Airlangga said at a joint press conference with the Indonesia Stock Exchange and financial services regulator.\r\n \r\nStudents and civil society groups called off planned protests on Sept 1, citing heightened security measures.\r\n \r\nThe demonstrations spread across Indonesia last week, initially over lawmakers\u2019 benefits before they intensified after a police vehicle hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver on Aug 28.\r\n \r\nPresident Prabowo Subianto has ordered the military and police to take stern action against rioters and looters, after homes of political party members and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati were ransacked.\r\n \r\nSome state buildings and public facilities such as toll booths in several cities were set ablaze.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe see that recovery and market confidence in the coming days will be strongly determined by how quickly social, political and security issues are addressed,\u201d Mr Rully Arya Wisnubroto, an analyst with brokerage Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said in a note to clients.\r\n \r\n\u201cIndonesia\u2019s economic conditions are relatively stable, though not outstanding. If investor confidence is not restored, short-term economic instability may occur,\u201d he added.\r\n \r\nThe economy grew by an annual 5.12 per cent in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years, according to official data.\r\n \r\nMr Airlangga said a programme giving free meals to students and pregnant women would be accelerated, and there would be new incentives such as loans for investment in property and labour-intensive sectors, adding that a task force would look into job creation opportunities. REUTERS\r\n \r\nJakarta protests ease after pay hike for lawmakers is reversed, but aftermath lingers\r\nAn analyst warns that if the government\u2019s response is seen as inadequate \u2013 or delayed \u2013 prolonged demonstrations could hurt private-sector investment and dampen spending on durable goods and tourism\r\n \r\n[JAKARTA] Protests in Jakarta, marked by vandalism and looting that damaged infrastructure, eased slightly on Monday (Sep 1) after President Prabowo Subianto scrapped a planned pay hike for lawmakers, but not before causing an estimated nine trillion rupiah (S$770 million) in economic losses, particularly in the Greater Jakarta area. \r\n \r\nThe retail, transportation and services sectors were hit hardest with the services sector \u2013 nearly half of the national economy \u2013 suffering a sharp three-day decline, indicated the Center for Economic and Law Studies (Celios).  \r\n \r\nBusinesses and analysts still remain cautious. Nailul Huda, digital economy director at Celios, warned that the situation remains delicate although the angst appears to have cooled. \r\n \r\nAri Jahja, head of Indonesia research at Macquarie Capital, said that investors are awaiting Prabowo\u2019s next steps, be it to address public demands or restore market confidence. \u201cIndonesia could emerge stronger if structural reforms are successfully implemented,\u201d he added.\r\n \r\nIndonesia\u2019s stock exchange closed down 1.21 per cent on Monday, while the rupiah strengthened 0.33 per cent, following a stronger-than-expected trade surplus in July.\r\n \r\nDamage tolls\r\nViolent protests in Jakarta damaged public transport infrastructure, with 22 TransJakarta bus stops vandalised, burned or looted, Governor Pramono Anung said on Monday. He estimated total losses at 55 billion rupiah.\r\nProtests in Jakarta subsided on Monday after days of unrest and looting, as some demonstrators held back following weekend riots. In Makassar, where last weekend\u2019s protests left four people dead, students marched to the local parliament building demanding justice for the victims, Kompas newspaper reported. \r\n \r\nA few mass demonstrations continued outside the parliament building in Central Jakarta, though in smaller numbers than last weekend. Police deployed around 5,000 personnel to secure the area, Central Jakarta Police Chief Commissioner Susatyo Purnomo Condro said.\r\n \r\nProtests are expected to continue in the coming days, with demonstrators urging Prabowo to enact policy reforms, including a review of the costly free lunch programme and redirecting its budget towards initiatives that could generate jobs and curb lay-offs.\r\n \r\nThe Indonesian Student Alliance, which had planned to stage another protest outside parliament, said it decided not to return to the streets on Monday after last week\u2019s rally ended in violence. Prabowo had earlier ordered firm action against violent protesters and increased security at key sites. \r\n \r\nUnrests in Jakarta have led to cancellations at hotels and restaurants, particularly in the city centre. Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of Indonesia Hotel and Restaurants Association, noted that cancellations began on Friday after demonstrations escalated and turned deadly, driven not only by safety concerns but also by heavy traffic and restricted access to central areas.\r\n \r\nHe added that while hotels and restaurants are still operating normally, the risk of temporary closures remains if tensions flare up again. \u201cThere is still anxiety that the unrest could escalate, so we have advised hotels to strengthen their security,\u201d he noted.\r\n \r\nHelmi Arman, Citi\u2019s chief economist for Indonesia, warned that if the government\u2019s response is seen as inadequate -\u2013 or delayed \u2013 prolonged protests could hurt private-sector investment and dampen spending on durable goods and tourism. \u201cIt is unclear to us at this juncture what kind of corrective actions it would take to appease the protests,\u201d he wrote in a note.\r\n \r\nIn Jakarta, military personnel were deployed to guard commercial facilities, including shopping malls and office towers, The Business Times observed. \r\n \r\nFoot traffic in Jakarta\u2019s Thamrin and Sudirman business districts was noticeably lighter than usual, as many offices implemented work-from-home arrangements amid lingering concerns that unrest could flare up again.\r\n \r\nPublic transport services, including TransJakarta and the mass rapid transit, resumed normal operations on Monday after being targeted by protesters. \r\n \r\nGrowth risks\r\nAnalysts said that rising political tensions in Indonesia are heightening economic risks, especially in the wake of the 19 per cent US tariffs that came into effect in August.\r\n \r\nIn a note, OCBC economists Lavanya Venkateswaran and Ahmad Enver noted that the impact of the tariffs is likely to start showing in August data. They projected that the economy will slow to 4.5 per cent in the second half of the year, down from 5 per cent in the first half, reflecting the combined effects of external and domestic pressures.\r\n \r\nThey added: \u201cIt remains to be seen whether the protests will prompt any significant policy changes under the Prabowo administration, but this is not our base case.\u201d\r\n \r\nIn a note, S&P Global Ratings analysts said that protests in several cities are unlikely to escalate to a level that would undermine political stability. They added that policy adjustments could include measures to support the economy and boost social spending.\r\n \r\nHowever, the analysts warned that if economic pressures intensify and fuel social tensions, it could become increasingly challenging for the government to balance competing spending priorities while maintaining fiscal discipline. \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nIndonesia\u2019s gas crunch strains domestic industries, may shake trust in exports\r\nThe tight conditions have led the authorities to ask overseas customers to accept shipment delays and to urge exporters to defer cargoes well into 2026\r\n \r\n[JAKARTA] Indonesia\u2019s growing gas shortage is forcing the government to prioritise domestic industries \u2013 a decision which analysts said could undermine its credibility as an exporter and may push long-standing partners such as Singapore to look elsewhere. \r\n \r\nThe supply crunch will also have a \u201csevere impact\u201d on Indonesia\u2019s gas-reliant manufacturers \u2013 from those in fertilisers and petrochemicals to ceramics and steel \u2013 as they face operational strain, threatening a fallout in investments and jobs.\r\n \r\nAlready, the tight conditions have led the authorities to ask overseas gas customers to accept shipment delays and to urge exporters to defer cargoes well into 2026, a decision which holds significant implications for importers.\r\n \r\nPang Lu Ming, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, said that while sellers and buyers may reallocate volumes, the original terms of the contract must still be honoured. \r\n \r\n\u201cDeviations from the contract should be accounted for in specific clauses within the contract which may allow for a swap of volumes,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf there are any deviations, negotiations and possible reparations will be required between the parties involved before further actions can be taken.\u201d\r\n \r\nResponding to queries from The Business Times, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) said that Singapore\u2019s natural gas supply remains stable. \u201cEMA will continue to closely monitor developments and work with industry partners to ensure Singapore\u2019s energy security and price stability,\u201d it added.\r\n \r\nTo safeguard against potential disruptions, Singapore sources natural gas from a diverse range of suppliers, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) from around the world and piped natural gas from Malaysia.\r\n \r\nIndonesia has been a pillar of South-east Asia\u2019s gas trade, supplying Singapore through pipelines and shipping LNG cargoes to buyers across Asia and beyond for decades. \r\n \r\nNow, with the gas crunch on, Indonesian factories and other industrial users are demanding more fuel just as production is slowing, making it a challenge for the country to both satisfy local needs and honour export commitments. \r\n \r\nBMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said that despite growth prospects for Indonesia LNG production, exports are unlikely to rise significantly in the near term as the government prioritises domestic consumption.\r\n \r\nIn the first half of this year, Indonesia\u2019s total gas consumption hit 5,598 billion British thermal units (BTU) per day, with nearly 70 per cent consumed domestically, and the remainder exported, underscoring the ongoing balancing act between meeting local demand and overseas commitments.\r\n \r\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources projects Indonesia\u2019s natural gas demand to exceed 6,000 billion BTU per day between 2025 and 2030, driven by rising industrial consumption and the government\u2019s energy-mix programme.\r\n \r\nSwap deal\r\nA multiparty gas swap was launched by SKK Migas, Indonesia\u2019s upstream regulator, on Aug 22 to ease immediate domestic shortages while maintaining existing export contracts.\r\n \r\nThe arrangement redirects 27 billion BTU a day from the West Natuna Supply Group, which includes Medco E&P Natuna, Premier Oil Natuna Sea and Star Energy (Kakap), to state-owned gas distributor Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) for domestic delivery.\r\n \r\nPhysical volumes are transported through pipelines operated by Medco E&P Grissik and PetroChina International Jabung in South Sumatra, which channel natural gas from Indonesia to Singapore. The deal involves key upstream contractors and buyers, including state-owned Pertamina and overseas buyers such as Singapore\u2019s Sembcorp Gas.\r\n \r\nIn March, Sembcorp announced that it had terminated the gas sales agreement its unit had signed to import piped natural gas from Indonesia\u2019s Mako gas fields, citing regulatory hurdles. \r\n \r\nPang from Rystad Energy said that swaps occur only under long-term agreements, where the characteristics of the gas molecules are clearly defined. \u201cThis is usually possible in regions with well-integrated pipeline networks.\u201d\r\n \r\nNatural gas powers more than 92 per cent of Singapore\u2019s electricity, sourced mainly through pipelines from Malaysia and Indonesia. The rest is imported as LNG.\r\n \r\nBalancing act\r\nUnder President Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia is racing to boost industrialisation and achieve 8 per cent growth, but the recent gas crisis shows that the country is caught between a rock and a hard place, balancing rising domestic demand with declining output.\r\n \r\nIn an information disclosure report released on Aug 15, PGN said that gas distribution from upstream oil and gas contractors fell in August, temporarily disrupting deliveries to several customers in West Java and parts of Sumatra. \r\n \r\nPGN attributed the disruption to an unplanned shutdown at existing gas suppliers and delays in finalising additional supplies, which affected both required volumes and distribution stability in the affected areas. \r\n \r\nManufacturers then raised the alarm. \r\n \r\nSeven manufacturing sub-sectors currently benefit from the government\u2019s subsidised gas price programme, locally known as HGBT: fertiliser, petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, ceramics, glassware and rubber gloves. But recent cuts in allocations have led to operational strain. \r\n \r\nIndonesian media reported that two tableware factories in Tangerang halted production and laid off around 700 workers earlier this month, citing gas supply restrictions.\r\n \r\nThe Ministry of Industry confirmed the pressure on manufacturers, with spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief warning that the shortage is hitting economic activity across sectors. \u201cThis crisis is having a severe impact on the manufacturing industry,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt affects not only manufacturers, but also investment sentiment, production processes and job creation.\u201d\r\n \r\nIndustry groups warned that the situation could worsen. Indonesia\u2019s Olefin, Aromatic and Plastic Industry Association has criticised the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, saying prolonged shortages could trigger mass layoffs.\r\n \r\nJakarta-based fatty acid manufacturer Sumi Asih reported that since Aug 13, it has been receiving less than half of its contracted gas volumes, which were initially capped at 48 per cent of the agreed quota and gradually lifted to around 70 per cent. This has left the company struggling to meet commitments to buyers in China and Europe.\r\n \r\nIn response to queries from BT, PGN said that the situation has been resolved, with industrial customers under the HGBT programme now receiving supplies based on the government\u2019s reallocation scheme.\r\n \r\nTemporary relief\r\nHowever, industry experts cautioned that the respite may be short-lived without deeper structural reforms.\r\n \r\nPrateek Pandey, senior vice-president at Rystad Energy, said that the swap could help secure additional volumes for the domestic market in the near term, likely through the end of this year and into next. \u201cBut over the longer horizon, Indonesia will need to either secure new long-term import contracts or accelerate the development of its substantial domestic resources,\u201d he explained.\r\n \r\nIndonesia\u2019s LNG exports fell gradually from 17 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2015 to 10 mtpa in 2023, largely due to declining output from the Tangguh and Bontang LNG plants and the government\u2019s decision to prioritise domestic consumption.\r\n \r\nProduction in South Sumatra, home to key blocks such as Pertamina EP, the Corridor Block and Jambi Merang, has been steadily falling for five years.\r\n \r\nFew new supply projects have come online to offset the declines, forcing regulators to redirect existing supplies to fertiliser plants, power stations and industrial users. New demand is also emerging, most notably from a power plant in Batam.\r\n \r\nUpcoming projects such as the Abadi LNG project, Indonesia Deepwater Development and exploration in the Andaman Sea could theoretically meet both domestic and export demand, but delays remain a major risk.\r\n \r\n\u201cIndonesia has enough potential to meet domestic demand while continuing exports,\u201d Pandey said. \u201cThe real risk is delays in development, which could affect investor sentiment.\u201d\r\n \r\nIndonesia is not alone in facing gas supply challenges. Malaysia may redirect more Sarawak output to domestic use, while Australia has long struggled to balance exports with local demand.\r\n \r\nPandey said that the broader lesson is that governments should focus on expanding supply rather than merely curbing exports. \u201cDeveloping pipeline resources already in the works and improving connectivity is critical. Many pipelines require both investment and investor attention.\u201d \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nIndonesian stock, bond selloff extends after weekend of unrest\r\n[JAKARTA] A sell-off in Indonesian stocks and bonds continued on Monday (Sep 1), weighed by growing concerns over political stability in South-east Asia\u2019s biggest economy.\r\n \r\nThe country\u2019s equity benchmark fell as much as 3.6 per cent, the most in nearly five months, before trimming losses to close down about 1.5 per cent, with financial shares including Bank Rakyat Indonesia among the biggest drags. The move came after protests heightened over the weekend in response to rising living costs and inequality. \r\n \r\nStress also was evident in the bond market, with yields on the nation\u2019s benchmark 10-year government paper up seven basis points to 6.4 per cent, the highest in almost three weeks. The rupiah was steady as the central bank continued its intervention to keep the currency stable.\r\n \r\nThe rout in Indonesian stocks and debt that started Friday marks a reversal of investor mood, when some global funds had just started rotating back into South-east Asian assets given lower valuations and potential monetary easing. Political turbulence, which is also plaguing Thailand at the moment, heightens the risk of foreign capital outflows that have accelerated in recent days. \r\n \r\nIndonesia\u2019s \u201cpolitical risk will rise, and so will the equity risk premium,\u201d said John Foo, founder of Valverde Investment Partners in Singapore. \u201cWe are underweight on Indonesia as the valuations do not reflect the underlying issues in the economy.\u201d \r\n \r\nPresident Prabowo Subianto cancelled a trip to China following the deadly unrest as demonstrators targeted the homes of Indonesia\u2019s finance minister and several lawmakers. On Sunday, Prabowo announced parliament will remove hefty lawmaker perks that had been a source of ire for many protesters.\r\n \r\nOutrage\r\nProtests in Indonesia were sparked last week by outrage over lawmakers\u2019 housing allowances- nearly 10 times the monthly minimum wage in Jakarta \u2013 and fuelled by tax hikes, mass layoffs, and inflation that have disproportionately hit lower-income Indonesians.\r\n \r\nBanks were among the biggest drags on the stock benchmark, with Bank Rakyat, Bank Central Asia, and Bank Mandiri Persero all down more than 4 per cent intraday.\r\n \r\nAny capital outflows would first hit the financial sector, Prasetya Gunadi, head of equity research at Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia, wrote in a note. \u201cBanks remain the most exposed, given their large index weight and potential liquidity stress if political instability triggers capital withdrawals.\u201d\r\n \r\nIndonesia\u2019s stock market attracted a net US$676 million from foreign investors in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its equity benchmark is up 8 per cent this year, having reached a record high before the unrest erupted.\r\n \r\nOn the currency front, the rupiah is one of the weaker performers in Asia this year, down over 2 per cent against the greenback.\r\n \r\n\u201cIndonesian stocks are poised for more declines with political risks clouding the outlook. The recent escalation weakens the outlook and raises the equity risk premium,\u201d said Mary Nicola, MLIV macro strategist. \u201cThat will keep Indonesian assets under pressure, and likely unwind the inflows seen in August.\u201d\r\n \r\nBNY downgraded its outlook on the rupiah to neutral from positive on Monday, because of the near-term political factors, according to Wee Khoon Chong, a senior strategist in Hong Kong.\r\n \r\n\u201cWhile we think such unrest is likely to be short-lived, investors will no doubt de-risk or increase hedges on their Indonesia portfolios,\u201d he said. \u201cAn acknowledgement of discontent and positive social and market reforms towards transparency and equity might restore confidence.\u201d\r\n \r\nThai woes \r\nPolitical turmoil is also rocking Thailand, where politicians are jockeying to lead the next government after the disqualification of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.\r\n \r\nThailand has struggled for decades to overcome political infighting, contributing to slower economic growth compared with regional rivals.

Investors spent US$664 million acquiring hotels in Australia, while in Singapore, they deployed US$546 million in the same period. South Korea rounded up the top markets, with US$504 million invested in the segment. \r\n \r\nJLL said: \u201cInvestors have gravitated to safe-haven markets, while decision-making timelines lengthened. At the same time, the bid-ask spread between seller expectations and buyer valuations has also widened with sellers holding firm on price expectations and buyers applying greater scrutiny, leading to extended due diligence periods on both sides of transactions.\u201d \r\n \r\nHigh-net-worth individuals from within the region emerged as increasingly active buyers in H1, seeking portfolio diversification through hotel investments, with capital invested into hotels growing 54 per cent from the same period last year. \r\n \r\nIn Singapore, investors gravitated towards boutique hotels. Duxton Reserve was sold in May 2025 for S$80 million, or about S$1.6 million per key. The 49-key boutique hotel was sold by Singapore-based hospitality company The Garcha Group to Lotus One Investment, the investment arm of Lotus Singapore, a family office focused on ventures in South Asia. \r\nIn April, the 48-key shophouse hotel 21 Carpenter was sold by 8M Real Estate to Indonesian-born, Singapore-based billionaire Leo KoGuan. According to industry sources, it was sold for S$100 million, or about S$2.1 million per key. \r\n \r\nHybrid hotels, with an extended-stay component, are also attracting investment from private-equity groups. \r\n \r\nTan Ling Wei, senior vice-president of investment sales at JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group, noted: \u201cSingapore\u2019s boutique hotel sector continues to attract private capital seeking both diversification and long-term capital value.\u201d \r\n \r\nLooking ahead\r\nFor the full year, hotel transaction value in Singapore is projected to reach US$1.2 billion, JLL said. This is higher than the US$744 million recorded in 2024.\r\n \r\nAcross the entire Asia-Pacific region, hotel transaction value is expected to total US$12.8 billion, an almost 5 per cent increase from US$12.2 billion in 2024. \r\n \r\n\u201cThis forecast anticipates accelerated investment activity in the second half of the year as the backlog of deals in due diligence are expected to settle then,\u201d noted JLL.\r\n \r\nIt added: \u201cAlthough institutional investors remain selective, private capital is moving decisively to secure prime hospitality assets that offer both defensive income characteristics and growth potential, which should ensure an uptick in activity in this year and into the next.\u201d\r\n \r\nJLL expects private-equity funds, family offices, and regional operators with access to private capital to emerge as the most active buyers for the rest of the year as they seek assets requiring operational expertise to maximise their value. \r\n \r\nSome analysts, however, are turning less sanguine on the outlook for Singapore\u2019s tourism and hospitality sector. \r\n \r\nFor the first seven months of 2025, the Republic had about 10 million tourists, 2.4 per cent higher than in the year-ago period, according to latest data from the Singapore Tourism Board. \r\n \r\nA report by OCBC Investment Research noted that in June 2025, revenue per available room was the lowest on record since January 2023.  \r\n \r\nWhile the Singapore government has put in significant effort to revitalise the tourism landscape through the opening of attractions such as Rainforest Wild Asia and the Singapore Oceanarium this year, weak hospitality momentum may persist due to tariff uncertainty and global growth concerns, OCBC said. \r\n \r\nCautious tourism sentiment, a strong Singapore dollar and China\u2019s slow recovery as a source market may also negatively impact the sector. \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nNew Zealand home-building approvals stuck in 15-month slumber\r\nThe government wants to reinvigorate the industry as it tries to revive economic growth\r\n \r\n[WELLINGTON] New Zealand home-building approvals remain in a slumber that extends back more than a year, adding to signs that weakness in the key construction industry may persist.\r\n \r\nThere were 33,879 consents issued in the 12 months to July, Statistics New Zealand said on Monday (Sep 1). That\u2019s the 15th straight month that the annual total has been below 35,000.\r\n \r\nConstruction has failed to stir even as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut its Official Cash Rate by 250 basis points since August last year. Worries about job security and a sluggish economic recovery have pushed potential home builders to the sidelines, while global economic uncertainty has hurt investor sentiment and curbed new residential developments.\r\n \r\nConstruction contracted 9.3 per cent in the 12 months to March, costing jobs and forcing some firms to close. Concrete production in the 12 months to June was the lowest in more than 10 years.\r\n \r\nThe government wants to reinvigorate the industry as it tries to revive economic growth and has unveiled a range of regulatory adjustments aimed at smoothing approval processes and making it cheaper to get a house built.\r\n \r\nThe sector may also get a lift if the RBNZ reduces borrowing costs further after it signalled on Aug 20 that there may be another 50 basis points of cuts to come before Christmas.\r\n \r\nWeakness in the underlying housing market also hampers the construction sector by making apartments and retirement village units less attractive for those who may want to downsize from a family home. House prices fell for the fourth straight month in July.\r\n \r\nToday\u2019s report showed 1,483 retirement units approved in the 12 months to July, down 16 per cent on the previous year.

BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nNew Zealand opens luxury home market to golden visa holders\r\nThe Active Investor Plus visa offers residency in exchange for a significant investment\r\n \r\n[WELLINGTON] New Zealand will loosen its ban on foreigners buying houses, opening the door for wealthy investors to purchase luxury properties as part of a push to revive its sluggish economy.\r\n \r\nThe coalition government on Monday (Sep 1) said that it will allow holders of so-called golden visas to buy houses worth at least NZ$5 million (S$3 million), carving out an exemption to restrictions that have largely kept overseas buyers out of the market since 2018. The change will not take effect until the end of the year, when reforms to the Overseas Investment Act are passed into law, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said.\r\n \r\n\u201cGlobally, New Zealand has a deserved reputation as a great place to live and we want to grow our economy,\u201d Luxon said. \u201cBy opening our door just a little to allow significant investors to own a home, we will help attract more of those who want to contribute to the community and country.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe move underscores Luxon\u2019s bid to lure more foreign capital to the South Pacific nation and comes five months after the relaunch of New Zealand\u2019s golden visa. Designed to attract high-net-worth individuals, the Active Investor Plus visa offers residency in exchange for a significant investment.\r\n \r\nThere were 308 applications for the visa covering 1,000 people as at Aug 31, amounting to a potential total minimum investment of NZ$1.9 billion, data from Immigration New Zealand shows. Around 40 per cent of applicants are from the US. \r\n \r\nAt the moment, participants in the visa programme are largely banned from buying property in the country.\r\n \r\nOnly New Zealand citizens, residents, and nationals from Australia and Singapore have been free to buy homes for the past seven years, following a clampdown by then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern amid fears that offshore buyers were fuelling a housing crisis. Adding to the pressure was a passport-for-sale scandal involving PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.\r\n \r\nThere are about 7,000 houses in New Zealand valued at more than NZ$5 million, just 0.4 per cent of the nation\u2019s housing stock, according to property consultancy Cotality. Around 4,500 are in Auckland, the nation\u2019s largest city, and about 1,250 are in the South Island ski-resort town of Queenstown.\r\n \r\nHowever, only around 350 of those trophy properties are typically put up for sale each year, meaning the pool of homes available to foreign buyers will be small.\r\n \r\nWhen Ardern first announced the foreign buyer ban in 2017, she said that it was to reduce property speculation and make it easier for first-time buyers to enter the market.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their first home, so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and driving up prices. Kiwis should not be outbid like this,\u201d she said at the time.\r\n \r\nHouse price impact\r\nStill, data showed foreigners accounted for only 2 to 3.5 per cent of sales before the ban.\r\n \r\n\u201cThis change navigates a path between those who do not want foreign ownership opened up, and the desire to attract high-net-worth investors by deepening their connection to our country to help grow the economy,\u201d Luxon said of Monday\u2019s announcement.\r\n \r\nThe impact on affordability for ordinary New Zealanders will be negligible, said Cotality chief property economist Kelvin Davidson.\r\n \r\n\u201cThere might be some people out there who are worried about what this is going to do to local house prices. Well, it probably won\u2019t do much,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cFor the wider housing market, there\u2019s much bigger restraints in the form of the weak labour market at the moment.\u201d \r\n \r\nHong Kong retail sales up 1.8% in July, sentiment steady\r\nIn volume terms, July retail sales increased 1% from a year earlier\r\n \r\n[HONG KONG] Hong Kong\u2019s retail sales by value rose by 1.8 per cent in July from a year earlier, the third consecutive month of gains, government data showed on Monday (Sept 1), and its government said consumer sentiment should remain steady.\r\n \r\nSales rose to HK$29.7 billion (S$4.88 billion), after a 0.7 per cent increase in June compared with the same month a year before.\r\n \r\nIn volume terms, July retail sales increased 1 per cent from a year earlier, compared with a 0.3 per cent fall in June.\r\n \r\nFor the first seven months of 2025, the value of total retail sales declined by 2.6 per cent compared with the same period in 2024, and volume fell 4.0 per cent.\r\n \r\nA government spokesman said local consumer sentiment should hold up. \u201cThe government\u2019s proactive efforts in promoting tourism and mega events will also benefit retail businesses.\u201d\r\n \r\nJuly visitor arrivals rose to 4.39 million, up 12 per cent from the same month a year ago, data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board showed. That compared with 3.48 million in June, 4.08 million in May and 3.85 million in April.\r\nThe number of mainland Chinese visitors stood at 3.51 million in July, up 11.8 per cent from a year ago. That compared with 2.61 million in June, 3.12 million in May and 2.81 million in April.\r\n \r\nHowever, many visitors from mainland China are visiting only for a day and keeping a tight rein on overall spending. Meanwhile, many local residents were spending more across the border, taking advantage of the Hong Kong dollar\u2019s relative strength against the Chinese yuan.\r\n \r\nSales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts rose 9.4 per cent year-on-year in July after a 6.9 per cent rise in June.\r\n \r\nSales of clothing, footwear and allied products increased 0.1 per cent year-on-year in July following a 4.6 per cent drop in June.

The talks are ongoing and details about the deal\u2019s size and structure could change.\r\n \r\nBlackstone and CapitaLand Group are among the firms engaged in the capital injection discussions, the people said. The two companies have also been in talks with New World to buy some of its assets, Bloomberg News reported earlier. \r\n \r\nNew World\u2019s shares extended their gains after the news, jumping as much as 10.3 per cent to HK$7.3 and putting them on track for their highest intra-day price in more than three weeks, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Some of its US dollar bonds also rose by at least one cent, according to several credit traders.\r\n \r\nDespite securing a record US$11 billion loan refinancing deal earlier this year, New World still needs more funding to help it cut debt and sustain its operations, as Hong Kong\u2019s property sector remains in the doldrums. \r\n \r\nThe company has been in talks over a potential Deutsche Bank-led loan deal, but missed a self-imposed target to complete the financing in mid-July. As of late last month, no bank has committed to the deal and parties involved expect the talks to drag on, the people said. \r\n \r\nSome potential investors involved in the talks have asked that the family offer its holdings in the Hong Kong-listed property firm as a security to hedge against potential risks, or have demanded dividend returns for their equity investment, some of the people added. \r\n \r\nIt remains unclear if the family would agree to any of the conditions, they said. The potential investors are not willing to commit to a deal if the family will not provide capital, the people explained.\r\n \r\nThe Cheng family office and New World did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Blackstone, CapitaLand and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\r\n \r\nOctus reported last month that Blackstone and the Cheng family were considering co-investing about US$2.5 billion into New World, with options discussed for the investment in the form of preferred or ordinary equity.\r\n \r\nWhile the Cheng family largely sat on the sidelines when New World was negotiating its loan refinancing with banks earlier this year, it did inject liquidity into the firm in 2023, when it bought out a subsidiary for HK$35.5 billion. The Chengs own about 45 per cent share of the builder.\r\n \r\nNew World\u2019s debt crisis stems from an aggressive expansion that came just before Hong Kong was rocked by political turmoil, the pandemic and a prolonged real estate slump. The company\u2019s net debt reached about 96 per cent of shareholders\u2019 equity as of December, the highest among all major developers in the city, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\r\n \r\nNew World is also seeking to sell a range of assets, including projects in mainland China and a mall near Hong Kong\u2019s international airport.

That was an apparent dig at US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war which has disproportionately affected developing economies such as India, whose exports were hit with a 50 per cent levy last week.\r\n \r\nChina will provide two billion yuan (S$360 million) of free aid to member states this year and a further 10 billion yuan of loans to an SCO banking consortium, he added.\r\n \r\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the meeting on Sunday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that China played a \u201cfundamental\u201d role in upholding global multi-lateralism.\r\n \r\nBeijing has also used the summit as an opportunity to mend ties with New Delhi.\r\n \r\nModi, who is in China on his first visit in seven years, and Xi both agreed on Sunday that their countries are development partners, not rivals, and discussed ways to improve trade ties amid the global tariff uncertainty.

Higher raw material costs were cited as a key reason for the increase in expenses.\r\n \r\nTo cope with rising costs, some producers raised their output charges while others were unable to pass on higher expenses to buyers due to intense competition, leaving average selling prices unchanged in August.\r\n \r\nSupplier lead times lengthened for the sixth month in a row in August, as respondents cited shipping delays and logistics constraints.\r\n \r\nOverall, factory bosses remained positive on the one-year outlook for output, with optimism at the highest since March amid hopes that economic conditions will improve and company expansion plans will help drive new sales.\r\n \r\nEconomists say economic fundamentals may worsen in the second half of the year, as US tariffs and payback from frontloading shipments to get ahead of the duties, alongside the still stagnant property sector, weigh on growth momentum. REUTERS\r\n \r\nChina banks pressured by rising loan losses, low margins\r\nOverall, the five biggest banks set aside allowances for losses on loans of 3.5 trillion yuan, in the first half\r\n \r\n[BEIJING] China\u2019s mega banks are under pressure from rising allowances for loan losses and a continued margin erosion in their mission to support the world\u2019s second-largest economy. \r\n \r\nThe lenders, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), on Friday (Aug 29) reported falling or weak earnings for the first half of 2025 as they continued to pump out new loans to China\u2019s struggling consumers.\r\n \r\nOverall, the five biggest banks set aside allowances for losses on loans of 3.5 trillion yuan (S$630 billion), in the first half, up almost 6 per cent from the end of last year.\r\n \r\nTheir finances are come under increasing strain due to their duties to help lift the economy out with cheap lending and loan subsidies. The sector\u2019s overall margin contracted further to a record low of 1.42 per cent as at June, below the 1.8 per cent threshold regarded as necessary for maintaining reasonable profitability for over two years. \r\n \r\nICBC said that it \u201cactively boosted consumption\u201d as such loans increased by 10.2 per cent in the period. Its net income fell 1.4 per cent from a year earlier to 168.1 billion yuan. Its net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, narrowed to 1.3 per cent from 1.43 per cent.\r\n \r\nICBC\u2019s performance may spell trouble in turning earnings around for the full year, according to Francis Chan, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The bank has \u201cvarious risks to revenue and limited room to reduce credit costs\u201d, he said in a note.  \r\n \r\nProfit at rivals China Construction Bank and Bank of China fell 1.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively, while net income at Agricultural Bank of China rose 2.7 per cent and Bank of Communications reported a 1.6 per cent gain. They all reported a narrower margin from a year earlier, while bad loan ratios slid from the end of 2024. \r\n \r\nThe combined profits of the country\u2019s commercial banks shrank 7.7 per cent from a year earlier to 1.2 trillion yuan in the first half, official data showed earlier this month. That marks the first decline since 2020, when the pandemic shut down factories and businesses.\r\n \r\nWhile the authorities have guided banks to lower funding costs via a round of cuts in deposit rates, Bloomberg Economics sees more monetary easing as likely as China addresses its economic weakness, further sapping loan yields for lenders. \r\n \r\nICBC vice-president Yao Mingde said that he expects the sector\u2019s margins will extend their downtrend in the second half, though the contraction will likely be slower. As for the bank itself, \u201cwe are confident that our net interest margin will see a marginal stabilisation in the future\u201d, he said at a press conference.

The remarks were made at the company\u2019s briefing for its first-half results, which was attended by executives, including chairman Zou Jixin.\r\n \r\nBaosteel is seeking to invest in operations outside of China to better compete on the global stage, and has made an investment in a steel plate venture in Saudi Arabia. On Friday, the company said that the project had a planned production capacity of 2.5 million tonnes and an initial budget of US$4 billion.\r\n \r\n\u201cAs our internationalisation strategy deepens and industry trends continue to evolve, establishing regional or full-process production lines overseas will become inevitable and a necessary step,\u201d Baosteel said.\r\n \r\nChina is also facing anti-dumping duties from a number of countries as they seek to keep out cheaper Chinese supplies after domestic use declined due to a prolonged property slump.\r\n \r\nLast week, Baosteel announced a 7 per cent increase in net income in the first half, a positive boost against the backdrop of oversupply and long-term doubts over future steel demand in the country. BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nChina\u2019s aluminium factories are changing to escape a crushing price war\r\nThe Asian nation\u2019s property boom is over, and has left behind small to medium-sized manufacturers saddled with overcapacity, evaporating margins and a relentless struggle for customers\r\n[BEIJING] For Liang Zhu, who runs an aluminium factory about 100 kilometres north of Hong Kong, there is only one way out of China\u2019s vicious spiral of excessive competition: shift away from inexpensive metal for window frames and door handles, and towards the specialised alternatives needed for iPads and airplanes.\r\n \r\nGuangdong province has long been a powerhouse of light manufacturing. Today, though, many companies such as Liang\u2019s are battling to survive in the era of \u201cinvolution\u201d, a term commonly used to describe the country\u2019s intense, self-harming industrial race. China\u2019s property boom is over, and has left behind small to medium-sized manufacturers saddled with overcapacity, evaporating margins and a relentless struggle for customers.\r\n \r\n\u201cWithout sufficient profits, there will be no funds to invest in innovation, research or in finding solutions for society,\u201d said Liang, general manager at Guangdong Mingzhu Metal Material Technology, a company he founded after returning from a spell working in Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a dilemma for us, so we look for ways to get out of this so-called involution.\u201d\r\n \r\nProducers of aluminium to be used in railings or furniture thrived in Guangdong from the early reform years of the 1980s up until the country\u2019s real estate crisis began in earnest five years ago. Since, the region has seen a wave of consolidation.\r\n \r\nIn July, Mingzhu Metal started up its first production line making items with \u201c7-series\u201d aluminium, a more complex product that\u2019s harder to rework and weld, more resistant to heat and easier to crack when cooling. Most importantly, it has lucrative buyers in China\u2019s emerging higher-value industries \u2013 from aerospace to electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer goods.\r\n \r\nAluminium is arguably the world\u2019s most versatile metal because it\u2019s lightweight, durable and does not rust. Extruders, as companies such as Liang\u2019s outfit are known, take thick bars of semi-finished metal and work it through several phases to form different shapes and profiles, from car frames to supports for solar panels.\r\n \r\nThis corner of the sector has long relied on real estate and infrastructure, so the collapse of construction activity since the start of the pandemic has been devastating. Operating rates for aluminium processors are at about 60 to 70 per cent for the best-performing companies, and at only 40 to 50 per cent for the weaker ones, according to researcher Shanghai Metals Market, or SMM. Both are below the 80 per cent level deemed a healthy minimum.\r\n \r\nMidstream aluminium producers are \u201cfacing complex situations such as weak domestic demand, increased uncertainty in foreign trade, and intensified internal competition in the industry\u201d, the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said in July. \u201cThe price competition situation is quite severe, and overall processing fees have reached a historic low.\u201d\r\n \r\nShandong Nanshan Aluminum, a major producer of extrusions in eastern China, is a case in point. The firm said last week it will close 120,000 tonnes of its total 320,000 tonnes of capacity after recording utilisation rates of just 59 per cent. It plans to shift its focus to higher-end products for industry and autos.\r\n \r\nPresident Xi Jinping has said that he wants to \u201cbreak involution\u201d, which means reducing the excessive competition and capacity levels blamed both for a cycle of domestic deflation and raising tensions with trade partners.\r\n \r\nThe campaign is taking different forms across industries. Nationwide coal output declined in July from a year ago, after government inspectors targeted mines that produce too much. Oil refining and petrochemicals are set for a sweeping overhaul. And bosses from EV companies and some tech giants have been called before regulators and warned about over-competition.\r\n \r\nAn hour\u2019s drive from Mingzhu Metal is China\u2019s \u201caluminium capital\u201d of Foshan, known for its panoply of extruders, fabricators and wholesale markets. Here, Foshan Golden Source Precision Manufacturing has passed through several phases of specialisation and technological upgrades since it was founded in the early 1990s.\r\n \r\nIts showroom exhibits include trailer ramps and bathroom fittings to hard disc components and parts for the Harmony trains that pioneered China\u2019s high-speed rail. The firm has hewn closely to the technological path prescribed by Xi\u2019s Made in China 2025 plan that was launched a decade ago.\r\n \r\nMost recently, Golden Source has developed components for EV charging points and lightweight fittings for airplane trolleys. When general manager Rain Tam took over the business from her father, its founder, she raised spending on technological research in order to cut costs and to improve product quality.\r\n \r\nEven then, there is intense competition.\r\n \r\n\u201cTechnological innovation helps profit margins for some products, but overall our margins will be a lot worse this year than last,\u201d said Wang Shunli, deputy general manager. \u201cRight now, when it comes to pricing, I feel the pressure is extremely high.\u201d\r\n \r\nChina\u2019s last round of industrial supply reforms after 2015 heralded changes across the sector, from the smelters that produce aluminium to the factories that handle the metal. For extruders, strict new controls on carbon emissions and energy consumption put the squeeze on smaller, less efficient firms.\r\n \r\nThat\u2019s left an environment that is complex, but also modestly positive. Chinese demand for the metal is set to grow 3.4 per cent this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. China Hongqiao Group, the biggest primary aluminium producer, gave an upbeat outlook after it reported a rise in first-half earnings.\r\n \r\n\u201cOverall aluminium consumption is trending upward, but the main issues are rapid capacity expansion and severe product homogenisation,\u201d said SMM analyst Liu Xiaolei. \u201cThe aluminium industry is shifting towards new energy sectors, but these are also experiencing clear overcapacity.\u201d\r\n \r\nIn Guangdong, managers and factory workers are settling in for a long battle. Unlike Xi\u2019s last round of supply-side reforms, there\u2019s little prospect of massive stimulus or a renewed construction boom to restore the growth rates of the past.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe whole industry is experiencing a test,\u201d said Golden Precision\u2019s Wang. \u201cFor now, we need to survive first, so that we can advance more in five, seven, eight years.\u201d BLOOMBERG\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nXpeng, smaller EV makers kick sales goals in China as BYD stalls\r\nOther EV startups are making market share gains against the big players, too\r\n \r\n[BEIJING] As BYD weathers a rough patch atop China\u2019s market for new-energy vehicles, other, smaller players are surpassing their sales goals by leaning into demand for cheaper cars.\r\n \r\nXpeng reported year-to-date deliveries of 271,615 units on Monday (Sep 1), more than three times the same number of cars it sold in the first eight months of 2024. A key reason is the launch last August of its MONA M03 model, which starts from just 119,800 yuan (S$21,556).\r\n \r\nThe entry-level electric vehicle (EV) competes with mass-market models from BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings but leverages Xpeng\u2019s highly regarded intelligent technologies. It\u2019s quickly become a bestseller, accounting for about 40 per cent of Xpeng\u2019s monthly sales.\r\n \r\nThat\u2019s translating directly into financial improvements for Xpeng. The carmaker\u2019s net loss narrowed in the second quarter while gross margins expanded to 17.3 per cent. During an earnings call last month, chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said that the EV maker expects monthly deliveries to consistently exceed 40,000 units starting in September.\r\n \r\nXpeng is also set to receive a boost from its newly revamped P7 sedan, which launched last week. First introduced in 2020, the refresh should \u201ckick off a product cycle acceleration\u201d, HSBC Holdings analysts led by Yuqian Ding wrote.\r\n \r\nBeyond its own product line, Xpeng is securing new revenue streams through strategic partnerships. On Aug 14, Xpeng and Volkswagen announced an expansion of their collaboration around electronic and electrical architecture for the German automaker\u2019s combustion engine and plug-in hybrid platforms in China. The move is expected to bring in additional software service revenue with considerable margins.\r\n \r\nOther EV startups are making market share gains against the big players, too.\r\n \r\nZhejiang Leapmotor Technologies reported monthly deliveries of 57,066 vehicles in August, an increase of more than 88 per cent year on year, according to a post on the company\u2019s official Weibo account. Consumers are rushing to showrooms to snap up its affordable models, such as the B10 and C10, which such as Xpeng\u2019s EVs, are packed with intelligent features.\r\n \r\nAs more boutique brands gain momentum, BYD looks in danger of missing its own target for 5.5 million shipments this year. Sanford C Bernstein now expects that number to be more like 5.1 million. BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nXi vows more investments to boost China-led security bloc\r\nChina will provide two billion yuan (S$359.9 million) in grants to member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation\r\n \r\n[TIANJIN] President Xi Jinping said his country will increase investments and loans to partners while outlining a plan to bolster a China and Russia-led security bloc and boost Beijing\u2019s global clout.\r\n \r\nChina will provide two billion yuan (S$359.9 million) in grants to member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) this year and issue an additional 10 billion yuan in loans to lenders in the group\u2019s interbank consortium over the next three years, Xi said on Monday (Sep 1) at the SCO summit.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe should make the pie of cooperation bigger, and fully utilise the endowment of every country so that we can fulfil our responsibility for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region,\u201d Xi told world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who are assembled in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.\r\n \r\nThe event gathers Xi\u2019s closest international allies, and is one of the landmark diplomatic summits of his more than decade-long rule. It comes at a time of heightened global tensions as Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs disrupt international trade flows and regional wars continue to flare.\r\n \r\nWithout naming any country, Xi called on the group to \u201coppose the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and bullying practices\u201d \u2013 a thinly-veiled reference to what Beijing sees as the US\u2019s strong-arm tactics in the trade war.\r\n \r\nXi said the group should set up an SCO Development Bank \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, an institution Beijing has pushed to establish since as early as 2010. He also announced plans to implement 100 \u201csmall and beautiful\u201d livelihood projects in member states and expand educational opportunities, including doubling SCO-specific scholarships.\r\nWhile the amounts pale in comparison with the US$50 billion financial support Xi pledged for Africa last year, the promised grants and loans represent a step-up from what was previously Beijing\u2019s \u201clargely rhetorical\u201d backing for the group, according to Eric Olander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project.\r\n \r\n\u201cThis is all indicative of Xi\u2019s drive to create a parallel international governance architecture outside of the US-European-led international order,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\nThe lineup of global leaders \u2013 which includes Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif \u2013 suggests there is potential to break new ground. The summit offers Putin a chance to talk with Xi and Modi directly about the outcome of his meeting in Alaska with Trump and the prospect of reaching an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.\r\n \r\nA bilateral meeting between Xi and Modi on Sunday saw the two leaders pledge to rebuild ties and announce the resumption of direct flights. Modi is making his first trip to China in seven years as both Beijing and New Delhi face steep tariffs from Washington.  \r\n \r\nInitially seen in the West as an eastern counterweight to Nato, the SCO bloc has expanded by adding new members that are either far removed from its original focus on Central Asia or, as in the case of India and Pakistan, are themselves embroiled in strife.\r\n \r\nThe SCO has nearly doubled in membership since being founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Counting observers and dialogue partners such as Mongolia and Saudi Arabia, that number expands to 26 nations, with a roster of countries including Myanmar and Turkey seeking full membership. BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nSamsung, SK Hynix sag after US revokes China chip gear permits\r\nNon-Chinese companies only spent about US$2 billion on new gear for their factories in that country in 2024\r\n[SEOUL] Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix shares slid on Monday (Sep 1) after the Trump administration decided to make it harder for the world\u2019s largest memory chipmakers to ship critical equipment to their giant Chinese operations.\r\n \r\nThe surprise ruling deals a potential blow to their production in the world\u2019s largest semiconductor market. While both South Korean companies have memory plants in South Korea, China accounts for a major slice of their global output. Samsung sank more than 2 per cent, while SK Hynix stock was more than 4 per cent lower in morning trading.\r\n \r\nSamsung and Hynix compete with Micron Technology to make key components for most electronics from Apple iPhones to Nvidia AI servers. The pair had operated in China under regulations that allow them to import chipmaking equipment without applying for a new license each time. They now have 120 days until the waiver expires, according to an announcement in the US Federal Register. Companies can seek licenses to continue operations.\r\n \r\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move would revise what\u2019s known as the validated end user, or VEU, rules, handicapping the ability to make chips in the country and jeopardising Beijing\u2019s access to certain technologies. \r\n \r\nThose waivers date back to 2023 when then-president Joe Biden\u2019s administration moved to allow the South Korean chipmakers to acquire the equipment they need to sustain and expand their giant operations in China. Washington effectively granted an indefinite waiver on broader restrictions banning the shipment of advanced chipmaking gear to the country. \r\n \r\nSK Hynix said on Friday that it would \u201cmaintain close communication with both South Korean and the US governments and take necessary measures to minimise the impact on our business\u201d. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to closing export control loopholes \u2013 particularly those that put US companies at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler, who oversees export control programmes, said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe US decision emerged days after US President Donald Trump met his South Korean counterpart, President Lee Jae Myung, at the White House. In their meeting, the two men discussed a recently sealed agreement that set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15 per cent, sparing the country from the 25 per cent that Trump had threatened. \r\n \r\nThe removal of the waiver will have a small impact on the market for semiconductor machinery, according to research from Bernstein. Non-Chinese companies only spent about US$2 billion on new gear for their factories in that country in 2024, accounting for less than 2 per cent of total industry sales on equipment last year.\r\n \r\nPlants in China owned by overseas companies do have an outsized influence on memory chip supply, though. They account for 10 per cent of computer memory output and 15 per cent of storage chips, according to the report. BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nJapan eyes record spending requests on rising debt, social welfare costs\r\n \r\n[TOKYO] Japan\u2019s government spending requests for next fiscal year will likely set a record for the third consecutive year, a draft of the requests obtained by Reuters showed on Monday, highlighting the challenge the country faces in fixing its dire finances.\r\n \r\nThe expected rise in spending comes on top of calls for tax cuts by opposition parties, which Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s minority coalition must heed to pass next year\u2019s budget through parliament.\r\n \r\nUnder next fiscal year\u2019s budget, government agencies will request a combined 122.45 trillion yen (S$1.07 trillion) in spending, the draft of the requests showed.\r\n \r\nThe biggest outlay would come from the health ministry, which requested 34.8 trillion yen in spending mostly to pay for rising social welfare costs for an ageing population.\r\n \r\nA record 32.4 trillion yen would be requested for servicing Japan\u2019s huge debt, as the central bank\u2019s interest rate hikes and rising bond yields push up the cost of borrowing.\r\n \r\nRequests for defence spending are also set to rise to a record 8.8 trillion yen, the draft showed.\r\n \r\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will scrutinise the requests to finalise the government\u2019s fiscal 2026 draft budget by the end of this year, which will then be submitted to parliament for deliberation.\r\n \r\nBond yields have risen recently as investors focus on how Ishiba\u2019s fragile political standing could affect Japan\u2019s efforts to rein in a debt pile which, at twice the size of its economy, is the biggest among its major peers.\r\n \r\nKnown as a fiscal hawk, Ishiba has faced calls from within his party to step down to take responsibility for a stinging upper house election loss in July.\r\n \r\nIshiba\u2019s administration will face its biggest test when his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will decide on Sep 8 whether to hold a race to choose a new party leader.\r\n \r\n\u201cIshiba, who emphasises fiscal discipline, has seen approval ratings rise,\u201d said Takahiro Otsuka, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \u201cBut considering the upcoming political calendar, markets haven\u2019t dispelled concern over the risk of further fiscal expansion.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday that spending requests under the fiscal 2026 budget will exceed 122 trillion yen. REUTERS\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nMizuho plans more dealmaking to become top Asia investment bank\r\n[TOKYO] Mizuho Financial Group is aiming to become Asia\u2019s top investment bank by bolstering equity underwriting and M&A advisory, seeking to replicate the headways the firm has made in the US.\r\n \r\nJapan\u2019s third-largest financial group plans to deepen ties between its banking and securities units in Asia and Europe in order to boost revenues, Yutaka Nanjo, head of global investment banking at Mizuho Securities, said. In the US, Mizuho wants to further leapfrog rivals to rank regularly in the top 10 for investment banking, Nanjo said. \r\n \r\n\u201cIn the US, we built our own platform ahead of competitors and are leading Japanese securities firms,\u201d said Nanjo, who sees UBS Group and BNP Paribas as competitors. \u201cWe must strengthen Europe and Asia, which are outside our core strength in the Americas.\u201d\r\n \r\nMizuho and its domestic rivals have long sought expansion overseas, undertaking acquisitions to drive growth. With deals in Japan now also reviving under a slew of corporate governance changes, banks are busy trying to find talent to pounce on the opportunities. \r\n \r\nIn the US, Mizuho bought a portfolio of North American loans from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 2015 to build its client base. More recently in 2023, the firm acquired US boutique advisory firm Greenhill & Co to forge deeper into investment banking. \r\n \r\nMizuho ranks 14th in the US for fee income from debt and equity capital markets as well as M&A advisory, for the fiscal year ended March, according to its investor relations presentation.\r\n \r\nWhile this trails Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase, it is far ahead of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s 20th position, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group\u2019s 29th place and Nomura Holdings\u2019 41st ranking, the presentation shows. The US business is profitable and a \u201cmajor pillar\u201d within investment banking, Nanjo said.  \r\n \r\nIn Europe, Mizuho is ranked 27th, while in the Asia Pacific, the firm is number three behind first-placed Nomura, according to the presentation. \r\n \r\nTo reach its ambition to be the top dealmaker in Asia within the next decade, Mizuho plans to intensify efforts to groom bankers who can do both commercial and investment banking, Nanjo said. It will also hire talent from outside the firm, he said, declining to elaborate on numbers. Its current Asia-Pacific head of banking Joris Dierckx is a BNP Paribas veteran who joined last October. \r\n \r\nNanjo also said that the firm is open to having a role in hostile corporate takeovers in Japan, where the taboo of being a financial adviser in these situations still lingers despite such M&As becoming more common. \r\n \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple decision,\u201d Nanjo said, adding the firm will discuss whether the takeover contributes to improving corporate value or strengthening Japan\u2019s competitiveness. \u201cIf there is a just cause, we will accept it. We want to handle each case carefully.\u201d BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\n\u2018Nikko\u2019 cut from new name of US$260 billion Japanese asset manager\r\nThe company is willing to leave familiar ground to expand globally\r\n \r\n[TOKYO] Nikko Asset Management is changing its name to Amova Asset Management, removing \u201cNikko\u201d for the first time since it was founded in 1959 in a sign the company is willing to leave familiar ground to expand globally.  \r\n \r\nThe new name of the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group unit mashes together the words \u201casset management,\u201d \u201cmove\u201d and \u201cnova,\u201d Latin for \u201cnew\u201d. The company oversees US$260.3 billion in assets.\r\n \r\nThe Tokyo-based company wanted the market to see that \u201cwe are not the firm from 65 years ago,\u201d said Stefanie Drews, Amova\u2019s chief executive officer, at an event. She said the asset manager\u2019s global growth plan seeks to \u201cexpand our business both organically \u2013 that means using our existing resources \u2013 and inorganically, creating further strategic partnerships.\u201d\r\n \r\nJapan\u2019s financial sector went through periods of major consolidation in about a decade and a half after the nation\u2019s asset-market bubble collapsed in the early 1990\u2019s. That prompted the biggest lenders to combine to survive in a tough market and get rid of their mountains of bad debt.\r\n \r\nThe high-pressure mergers and acquisitions often led banks to keep the relations between the consolidating firms vague, prompting some of the companies to come up with names that didn\u2019t reflect their pre-M&A identities. Mizuho Financial Group, for example, united three firms including Industrial Bank of Japan, none of whose names contained \u201cMizuho,\u201d a word for rice plants.       \r\n \r\nSumitomo Mitsui Trust Group\u2019s name, meantime, starts with \u201cMitsui Sumitomo\u201d when written in Japanese, the same reversal that\u2019s seen in the name of the financial group. \r\n \r\nSeoul moves ahead with 1st K-pop venue, opening set for 2027\r\n \r\nSEOUL \u2013 South Korea\u2019s Seoul Arena is set to open in the first half of 2027 to address Seoul\u2019s lack of a large concert hall dedicated to musical events as the city\u2019s first K-pop\u2013centered cultural venue, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said on Sept 1.\r\n \r\nCurrently under construction in Dobong-gu, north-eastern Seoul, Seoul Arena is slated to become the capital city\u2019s first concert hall capable of hosting over 20,000 spectators, with the city government seeking to fill a large gap in performance infrastructure.\r\n \r\nDespite its reputation as the hub of K-pop, Seoul has long been under criticism for its lack of music venues dedicated to concerts with more than 10,000 seats.\r\n \r\nDue to this lack of infrastructure, concerts are often held in sports stadiums.\r\n \r\nFor artists needing larger venues, shows are pushed to the outskirts of the capital in Incheon and Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.\r\n \r\nSeoul Arena is expected to span from two basement levels to six floors above ground, featuring two performance venues. Its main arena will hold up to 28,000 visitors, while its mid-sized hall will fit up to 7,000 people.\r\n \r\nThe city government added that Seoul Arena\u2019s musical venues will also be equipped with advanced acoustic systems, flexible staging and optimised sightlines for audiences, addressing long-standing issues at existing facilities where poor acoustics, obstructed views and stage restrictions have been frequent complaints.\r\n \r\nIn addition to its performance venues, other cultural facilities \u2013 such as shopping venues and a cinema \u2013 will be located inside the arena.\r\n \r\nThe city government also sees Seoul Arena as a driver for regional revitalisation.\r\n \r\n\u201cAs north-eastern Seoul was previously a culturally underserved area, (Seoul Arena) could transform it into a hub for culture and tourism, while also stimulating the local economy in nearby north-eastern Gyeonggi Province, symbolising balanced regional development,\u201d said the city government through its press release.\r\n \r\nThe venue will also be located near Changdong Station on Seoul Subway Line numbers 1 and 4, and Nowon Station on Line numbers 4 and 7.\r\n \r\nOnce the upcoming GTX-C express line finishes construction nearby, the site will also be accessible within 20 minutes of central Seoul and Gangnam, and within an hour from Incheon Airport.\r\n \r\nOn Sept 1, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon visited Seoul Arena\u2019s construction site to inspect its progress and safety management.\r\n \r\n\u201cIn a year and a half, Seoul Arena will stand as a world-class concert landmark that global artists seek out,\u201d said Mr Oh.\r\n \r\n\u201cThrough the provision of world-class performance infrastructure long sought by the pop culture industry, the city government aims to draw 2.7 million visitors annually and serve as a catalyst for the growth of K-pop and the broader entertainment sector.\u201d THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\r\n \r\nAirbus faces sprint to hit target after about 60 deliveries in August\r\nDeliveries are the company\u2019s main near-term industrial target\r\n \r\n[PARIS] Airbus needs to deliver planes at a record pace to reach its annual target after delivering about 60 aircraft in August, industry sources and analysts said on Monday (Sept 1).\r\n \r\nThe world\u2019s largest planemaker is aiming for a 7 per cent increase in deliveries to 820 jets this year, but has been hit by delays in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Deliveries are the company\u2019s main near-term industrial target and determine revenue and cash generation, as well as affect airline growth plans.\r\n \r\nIf confirmed, a tally of about 60 aircraft in August would mark a sharp increase from the same month in 2024 but still leave cumulative 2025 deliveries about 3 per cent behind the same point last year, at about 433 jets, analysts said.\r\n \r\nAirbus declined to comment ahead of the publication of monthly data early on Friday. In July, the planemaker reaffirmed its annual target of \u201caround 820\u201c deliveries, up from 766 in 2024. Airbus has been in a tug of war with engine maker CFM as airlines clamour for spare engines in competition with assembly lines for new aircraft. It said in July that it also faced engine delays from Pratt & Whitney.\r\n \r\nAirbus has been producing aircraft without engines in anticipation of a surge of engine arrivals in the second half of the year and reported 60 of what are called \u201cgliders\u201d in the system when posting mid-year results.\r\n \r\nIt has said that once engines arrive, it needs one to two months to convert a semi-complete airframe into an airliner ready for delivery. That will put pressure on Airbus to whittle down a significant part of the deficit in the third quarter.\r\n\u201cI still feel it\u2019s doable ... but September is going to be the real test,\u201d Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said.\r\n \r\nVeteran industry watcher Rob Morris, ex-head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend, warned Airbus would have to outdo even the record performance seen before the pandemic, which inflicted damage on suppliers that has yet to be fully repaired.\r\n \r\nBased on Cirium\u2019s estimate of 58 deliveries in August, he said Airbus would need to deliver an average of 97 aircraft a month between September and December to hit its full-year goal.\r\n \r\nThat would need to be 5 per cent better than the previous highest average for that period of 92 aircraft in 2018 or 91 in 2019.\r\n \r\nUsing statistical methods based on past performance, there is a 5 per cent chance that Airbus will get to 810 deliveries this year, Morris said.\r\n \r\n\u201cMy own personal view is that they will achieve around 790-800,\u201d he added. Airbus deliveries were briefly eclipsed by Boeing during a slow start to the year, but the European company is on course to remain the world\u2019s largest planemaker this year as its rival\u2019s activity recovers gradually from internal crises. REUTERS\r\n \r\nRevolut begins secondary share sale at US$75 billion valuation\r\nThe deal will cement the company\u2019s status as one of the most valuable fintechs on the planet\r\n \r\n[LONDON] Revolut has kicked off a process for some employees to sell their shares in the company at a US$75 billion valuation. \r\n \r\nThat secondary sale will value each share at US$1,381.06, according to a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg. The company has already fielded demand for the sale from new and existing investors, the memo shows.\r\n \r\nThe deal will cement Revolut\u2019s status as one of the most valuable fintechs on the planet. It is up from the US$45 billion valuation Revolut received in a secondary share sale last year, and puts the firm\u2019s price tag above the market capitalisation of Barclays, albeit in a private sale rather than on the public markets. \r\n \r\n\u201cAs part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,\u201d a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cAn employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won\u2019t be commenting further until it is complete.\u201d\r\n \r\nLondon-headquartered Revolut has grown rapidly and served more customers than HSBC Holdings last year, helping the British fintech to boost revenue 72 per cent to US$4 billion and grow its profit. The firm now has more than 60 million customers.\r\n \r\nThe digital finance company is pursuing further international growth, exploring hiring investment bankers for a possible acquisition in the US in order to gain a banking licence there, Bloomberg previously reported. BLOOMBERG \r\n8PR ASIA\r\nMcLaren F1 team valued at more than \u00a33 billion in stake sale: sources\r\nIt is the latest bumper valuation for an F1 team amid the growing interest in the sport from fans and investors\r\n \r\n[LONDON] McLaren Racing, the Formula One team that\u2019s currently leading the championship, will be valued at more than \u00a33 billion (S$5.2 billion) in a stake sale, according to two people familiar with the matter, underscoring continued investor bullishness about the sport.\r\n \r\nThe owners of McLaren Group Limited \u2013 Bahrain sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat and Abu Dhabi-based CYVN Holdings \u2013 will take full control of the racing team, the people said, asking not to be named discussing the deal.\r\n \r\nThey will buy out the 30 per cent stake owned by MSP Sports Capital and other minority shareholders who bought into McLaren in 2020 at a valuation of \u00a3560 million. Walmart heir Rob Walton was also an investor during the round, Bloomberg previously reported.\r\n \r\nMcLaren Racing and MSP declined to comment. The stake sale was first reported by Sky News.\r\n \r\nIt is the latest bumper valuation for an F1 team amid the growing interest in the sport from fans and investors. The Aston Martin team is in talks to achieve a roughly \u00a32.4 billion valuation in its latest stake sale, even though it\u2019s well behind the frontrunners in the championship table.\r\n \r\nThe sport has boomed under the ownership of Liberty Media, thanks in part to the success of the Netflix behind-the-scenes show Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which has attracted new fans, particularly in the US. The recent F1: The Movie starring Brad Pitt has further broadened the sport\u2019s appeal.\r\n \r\nLed by chief executive officer Zak Brown, McLaren Racing won the team championship last year for the first time in 26 years. The team\u2019s drivers \u2013 Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris \u2013 are currently the top two contenders to win the drivers\u2019 championship for McLaren for the first time since 2008.\r\n \r\nWhile the F1 team\u2019s been riding high, there is plenty of work to do at the high-end sports car maker McLaren Automotive that is part of the group. \r\n \r\nCYVN is aiming to reverse years of losses at the cash-strapped manufacturer. McLaren has had to tap shareholders for funding on multiple occasions in recent years, sell some of its heritage car collection, offload its advanced technologies arm and completed a sale and leaseback of its Woking headquarters.

In March, CEO Christian Sewing said headcount at its retail bank will be cut by almost 2,000 people in 2025, with a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction in branch numbers.\r\n \r\nIn India, Deutsche wants to completely sell its retail banking business, which spans 17 branches, according to the two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as the discussions are private.\r\n \r\nA Deutsche Bank spokesperson said it does not \u201ccomment on rumours or market speculation\u201d.\r\n \r\nThe sources said Deutsche had set an August 29 deadline for non-binding bids from several banks for its retail India assets.

BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nSpirit Airlines bankruptcy tees up painful cuts in survival bid\r\nFlying has bounced back, but the whipsaw market conditions, including a new trend of late bookings, has undermined carriers\u2019 ability to forecast demand\r\n \r\n[DALLAS] Spirit Aviation Holdings\u2019 second bankruptcy filing in a year signals that the low-cost carrier is finally facing up to the painful steps needed to ensure its survival.\r\n \r\nBut its board faces daunting challenges on the path ahead, including how to downsize its fleet of leased aircraft while managing the roller coaster market conditions for US air travel that complicate the prospects for a long-term recovery.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe general criticism of the first bankruptcy is that Spirit wasn\u2019t aggressive enough in cost-cutting and only using the filing to address debt to some extent (perhaps not enough even then),\u201d Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in an e-mail. \u201cSpirit has been making many adjustments already since last fall. However, further cuts appear likely.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe bankruptcy, filed late on Friday (Aug 29) in New York, lists assets and liabilities of between US$1 billion and US$10 billion. The petition comes amid active negotiations with some of its largest lessors, secured noteholders and key stakeholders, the carrier said.\r\n \r\nSpirit\u2019s petition underscores the difficulty facing discount airlines in the US, from high labour costs to the ever-present struggle to grow enough to protect margins. \r\n \r\nMuch larger and more diversified carriers such as United Airlines Holdings and Delta Air Lines are adding to the pressure, selling \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares to lure cost-sensitive passengers away from cheaper options at Spirit and rivals such as Allegiant Travel, Frontier Group Holdings and even Southwest Airlines. \r\n \r\nSouthwest is fighting back with an extensive makeover plan, offering premium fares with more legroom and assigned seats \u2013 breaking away from the one-size-fits-all business model it championed for five decades. Spirit and Frontier also have adjusted their business models to include upscale options.\r\n \r\nMarket turbulence \r\nIt\u2019s unclear how dramatic an overhaul Spirit could pursue. \r\n \r\nUltra-low-cost carriers are hit harder when there\u2019s too much capacity on routes, forcing them to cut fares at the expense of profits. Unlike the industry\u2019s leaders, Spirit lacks long-haul international routes that can make up for weakened demand in the domestic market.\r\n \r\nSpirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, while the US airline industry was in the midst of a sharp decline in flying by consumers concerned with US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and rising inflation. \r\n \r\nFlying has bounced back, but the whipsaw market conditions, including a new trend of late bookings, has undermined carriers\u2019 ability to forecast demand. \r\n \r\nThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about what carriers will be able to charge for tickets, given airline capacity plans are still being adjusted for the crucial holiday travel period, analysts say. An oversupply could gut fares, heaping extra pressure on lower cost carriers more so than larger operators.\r\n \r\nAircraft glut\r\nIf history is any guide, Spirit\u2019s board will have more than market forces to worry about. \r\n \r\nPart of Spirit\u2019s challenge will be how to downsize its fleet as it works to cut costs. It\u2019s expected to encounter tough negotiations with lessors, which supply the bulk of Spirit\u2019s fleet. In bankruptcy, some airlines have been allowed to return planes on lease, though it\u2019s unclear whether Spirit will be able to win approval to pursue that path.\r\n \r\n\u201cWith the current board and management, we expect a more aggressive review of costs and negotiation with partners, most notably lessors,\u201d Syth said.\r\n \r\nIn a filing, Spirit said that it received a written notice of default on Aug 25 from aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings, which said it was terminating dozens of leases on aircraft that were scheduled for delivery to Spirit in the coming years.\r\n \r\nTermination would cost Spirit more than US$2 million per lease and apply to dozens of aircraft, the filing said. Spirit disputed the notion of a default and said that the termination of leases was invalid.\r\n \r\nAs of Jun 30, Spirit had 215 Airbus A320-family aircraft, including 148 financed under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043. It owns 49 planes and has 18 under finance leases.\r\n \r\nSpirit may try to return as many as 150 leased planes, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. Less than 50 per cent are likely to return to the domestic market, she said, because most carriers already have sufficient capacity to meet demand.\r\n \r\n\u201cThis bankruptcy will be harder and look different than last year,\u201d leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA at Spirit told members on Friday. The airline will likely offer more extended voluntary leaves to employees, the union said. Previously announced pilot furloughs and downgrades will take effect in October and November.\r\n \r\nTakeover target\r\nAirlines operating in Chapter 11 can be particularly vulnerable as takeover targets, and the proceedings could make Spirit more susceptible to a suitor.\r\n \r\nThe carrier\u2019s filing comes a day after Bloomberg reported that Spirit engaged rival Frontier Group Holdings in high-level talks about the carrier\u2019s ongoing efforts to chart a path forward. Frontier and Bill Franke, the Frontier chairman, have pushed for years for a combination of the two lower-cost carriers.  \r\n \r\nAmerica West Airlines merged with bankrupt US Airways Group in 2005. The combined company, operating under the US Airways name, acquired American Airlines parent AMR in 2013 to bring that carrier out of bankruptcy.\r\n \r\nSpirit was bruised by a 2022 takeover battle between JetBlue Airways and Frontier. Spirit eventually agreed to be acquired by JetBlue in a US$3.8 billion deal, but the combination was blocked in January 2024 by a federal judge on antitrust grounds. BLOOMBERG\r\n8PR ASIA\r\nWealthy Americans pour record sums into private credit funds\r\nThe inflows point to the growing importance that major private investment groups are now placing on individuals, even as inflows from large institutions slow down\r\n \r\nPRIVATE credit funds are drawing in record sums of capital from everyday investors, offsetting a slowdown from large institutions as wealthy individuals are lured in by the higher returns on offer.\r\n \r\nAffluent individual investors in the US have pumped US$48 billion into private credit funds in the first half of this year, already surpassing the entire haul in 2023 and on pace to eclipse 2024\u2019s high-water mark of US$83.4 billion, investment bank RA Stanger has said.\r\n \r\nEuropean investors are also diving in, with assets in so-called evergreen private debt funds across the continent, more than doubling from a year ago to 24 billion euros (S$36.1 billion) at the end of June, said consulting firm Novantigo.\r\n \r\nThe inflows underscore the growing importance that major private investment groups are now placing on individuals; analysts at rating agency Moody\u2019s are calling it \u201cone of the biggest new growth frontiers in the industry\u201d.\r\n \r\nIt also represents just the tip of the spear for groups that had lobbied heavily to open the broader US retirement market up to private equity and credit. Their push culminated in US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order in August that paved the way for their broader inclusion in 401k plans.\r\n \r\nBrad Marshall, Blackstone\u2019s head of private credit, said: \u201cThe growth is coming from a very under-penetrated market. Private markets offer investors a premium (over) what they can get in public markets.\u201d\r\n \r\nFundraising in traditional drawdown, private credit funds has slowed alongside a broader downturn for the leveraged buyout industry, which has struggled to return capital to investors in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic and has, in turn, suffered weaker inflows.\r\n \r\nData from Preqin shows that private credit vehicles pitched to large investors, including endowments and pensions, have raised successively less every year since hitting a peak in 2021.\r\n \r\nNew contributions from wealthy individuals, by contrast, have accelerated. They have been spread across a handful of different vehicles, complicating comparisons between firms. \r\n \r\nThe Stanger data focuses on non-traded business development companies as well as interval funds, which offer redemptions at set periods. Collectively, they are known as evergreen funds, because they do not wind down on a specific date in the future. Investors can also continuously put more money in.\r\n \r\nFlows into the vehicles were stable during market swings earlier this year, after US President Donald Trump launched his tariff blitz against most of the US\u2019 largest trading partners. That has bolstered confidence that demand from individuals is durable, and that smaller investors will not race to redeem at the first sign of turbulence.\r\n \r\nJohn Sweeney, who runs wealth solutions at Brookfield, said: \u201cIt reinforced what we\u2019d want to see \u2013 people not running from alternatives, but looking at alternatives and saying there was stability there.\u201d  \r\n \r\nBlackstone has long dominated the market, although it is facing intensifying competition from rivals such as Apollo Global Management, Blue Owl, Ares Management and BlackRock\u2019s HPS Investment Partners.\r\n \r\nBlackstone\u2019s private credit fund, known as Bcred, has drawn in US$6.5 billion so far this year, and US$11.7 billion over the past 12 months. On the average day markets are open, individual investors are placing more than US$50 million of orders for the fund, the Stanger data shows, putting it at the top of the pack.\r\n \r\nThose inflows, supercharged by leverage, have pushed the size of Bcred up more than 50 per cent in the past two years, to US$73 billion in June.\r\n \r\nOthers are catching up. Apollo\u2019s offering, Apollo Debt Solutions, has raised US$6.4 billion over the past year, and two large funds from Blue Owl have taken in roughly US$7 billion. Ares\u2019 main offering for wealthy individuals, the Ares Strategic Income Fund, has raised US$5 billion.\r\n \r\nA smaller investment management firm, Cliffwater, has won massive share among independent wealth managers. Its fund has gone toe-to-toe with Blackstone, raising nearly US$11 billion in the past year, and now stands at more than US$30 billion.\r\n \r\nBlackstone was earlier than many of its rivals as it charged into wealth management offices, pitching major players such as Morgan Stanley and UBS, as well as the independent advisers that direct how millions of Americans save for retirement.\r\n \r\nThat resulted in near total market share for its product among other business development companies (BDCs) that are not publicly traded, sitting just below 90 per cent in 2021, noted Stanger. While it has remained the top draw for wealth managers, that figure has fallen to 28 per cent among similar vehicles amid a wave of new fund launches.\r\n \r\nRaj Dhanda, global head of wealth management at Ares, said wealth managers were keen to expand the number of funds they could pitch clients, given that Blackstone\u2019s \u201cshare of the market was probably uncomfortably high\u201d.\r\n \r\nBut he noted that it was still a small set of asset managers drawing in investors. \u201cAfter a small group of the leading global alternative managers, the flows fall off considerably,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\nEuropean private markets are also seeing a surge of interest from individual investors, sparking a wave of new fund launches across the continent. Novantigo counts 37 private credit evergreen funds in the market, up from just six in 2022. Ares and Blackstone have both been fundraising, and HPS is launching its own vehicle, according to a filing.\r\n \r\nPrivate credit itself has moved into the mainstream after post-crisis regulations limited lending by the traditional banking system. Major asset managers stepped into that void, lending directly to businesses and consumers.\r\n \r\nThe rapid pace of inflows has caused consternation from some inside the industry, even as their management fees swell. The inflows have materialised alongside a broad market rally, which has led to stiff competition among investors in private and bank syndicated loans. That has weighed on returns, as private lenders compete aggressively to win deals.\r\n \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky investment environment, driven by the imbalance between supply and demand of capital,\u201d Joshua Easterly, a top executive at Sixth Street, said on an earnings call this summer.\r\n \r\n\u201cCompetition is elevated, and it\u2019s increasingly difficult to generate outsized returns.\u201d  FINANCIAL TIMES\r\n \r\nChanel owners lean on 38 year-old heir to protect their billions\r\n \r\n[PARIS] Arthur Heilbronn has all the traits of being groomed to wield power over one of the world\u2019s biggest multi-generational fortunes.\r\n \r\nDeep family connections? Check. Ivy League degree? Check. Wall Street smarts? Check.\r\n \r\nNow there are growing signs the scion from the dynasty behind the Chanel empire is moving closer to the top of the firm overseeing its US$90 billion fortune. \r\n \r\nHeilbronn, 38, has taken on management positions overseeing his and his relatives\u2019 real estate, banking and media investments in the six years since joining Mousse Partners, one of the world\u2019s largest and most discreet family offices. In the latest indication of ascent for the Harvard Business School graduate and ex-Goldman Sachs banker, he became a director earlier this year for one of Mousse\u2019s main holding entities, occupying a role vacated following the death of longtime Chanel executive Michael Rena, according to registry filings.\r\n \r\nHe is also the son of Charles Heilbronn, founder of Mousse and the firm\u2019s chairman since 1991. Charles is a half brother of Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, third-generation heirs to the Chanel fortune.\r\n \r\nThe Wertheimers are grandsons of one of the original business partners of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel who started the fashion house in 1910. They shared the same mother as Charles, Eliane Heilbronn, who was considered the empire\u2019s matriarch until she died last year. Her sons are all in their 70s. \r\n \r\nA representative for Mousse declined to comment. \r\n \r\nThe Wertheimers, credited with owning equal shares of closely-held Chanel, each have a net worth of about US$45 billion, according to the Bloomberg billionaires Index. Their fortune has largely held up in the post-pandemic era, even as a downturn in luxury goods hit rivals including LVMH, led by Bernard Arnault, and Kering, controlled by the Pinault family. \r\n \r\nArthur Heilbronn\u2019s rise gives some indication of the succession plans of the media-shy extended family, which has long sought to keep its wealth out of the public eye. Gerard Wertheimer\u2019s son David has started a private equity venture, though there\u2019s no indication that other children of the two heirs are involved with Mousse.\r\n \r\n\u201cThey feel less like a family office and more like a private endowment for a luxury empire,\u201d Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices, said of Mousse. Among its peers, \u201cwhat puts them in the true top 1 per cent isn\u2019t size; it\u2019s time; dividend-fed, multi-cycle patience.\u201d\r\n \r\nAt least one-fifth of individuals among the world\u2019s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totalling more than US$4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg billionaires Index.\r\n \r\nA recent survey of 317 family office clients at UBS Group found just over half of them have a succession plan in place, with those in the US and South-east Asia most likely to have made those arrangements.\r\n \r\nHeilbronn joined Mousse as a director in 2019, moving to managing director a few years later, according to his LinkedIn profile. He\u2019s currently co-head of private equity and venture direct investing with another managing director, Paul Yun. He was named to the supervisory board of Rothschild & Co after Mousse Partners made one of its most high-profile investments to date by joining two other French dynasties in 2023 to help take the bank private. \r\n \r\nChanel\u2019s ultimate holding company is the Wertheimers\u2019 Cayman Islands-based Mousse Investments, which doesn\u2019t reveal financial numbers. Mousse Partners is the investment division and also has offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.\r\n \r\nMousse Investments describes itself as having a \u201cbroad range of asset classes in public and private markets\u201d in addition to Chanel. While Mousse doesn\u2019t disclose how much money it controls, some companies have named Mousse Partners as a participant in deals or as a shareholder. That points to investments in stocks, real estate, credit and private equity.\r\n \r\nMousse Partners employs more than three dozen people worldwide and counts former banking analysts from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo among its employees. Suzi Kwon Cohen joined as chief investment officer almost a decade ago after leading North America private equity for Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC, putting her among the top female executives in the historically male-dominated family office space.\r\n \r\nOver the years, Mousse Partners has backed a wide range of startups including mental health provider Brightside Health, digital advertising firm Brandtech Group, biotechnology company Evolved by Nature, food company Harmless Harvest and health-care provider Thirty Madison. Last year Mousse joined the billionaire L\u2019Oreal heiress investing in high-end clothing brand The Row.     \r\n \r\nNot all bets have proved lucrative. Beautycounter failed last year while a pair of Mousse\u2019s public holdings are languishing. The family office has a roughly 8 per cent stake in listed French digital entertainment company NetGem and 5.7 per cent in hair products maker Olaplex Holdings Both companies\u2019 share prices collapsed from their initial public offering levels and haven\u2019t recovered. \r\n \r\nMousse has also been invested for decades in France\u2019s publishing and audiovisual industry through Media-Participations, which owns a range of book publishing, specialised media, cartoon and comic businesses. \r\n \r\nThe family behind Chanel, a maker of US$970 sunglasses, US$6,500 handbags and US$23,400 J12 watches, has joined other French luxury billionaires with media holdings at home. Bernard Arnault owns newspapers Les Echos and Le Parisien along with the glossy weekly Paris Match. The Pinault clan owns magazines Le Point and Point de Vue. \r\n \r\nWhile Mousse is not involved in Chanel\u2019s operations, both companies have offices in a glass tower just south of Central Park in Manhattan that\u2019s famed for its pricey rents and list of major financial tenants. Both Arthur and Charles Heilbronn listed their workplace address at that New York premises on Manhattan\u2019s \u201cBillionaires Row,\u201d where Alain Wertheimer has also long-held an office.\r\n \r\nBehind closed doors on that street, the next steps in the succession plans for Mousse Partners may already be taking shape, though it\u2019s unlikely anyone in the dynasty behind Chanel will comment publicly on the matter.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very discreet family,\u201d Gerard Wertheimer once said in 2001. \u201cWe never talk.\u201d BLOOMBERG\r\n \r\nDrill, baby, drill: Has Big Oil learnt anything from Deepwater Horizon?\r\nThe legacy of history\u2019s largest marine spill is back in focus as the industry prepares to go even deeper\r\n \r\nTHIS month 15 years ago, the US government declared the Deepwater Horizon oil well sealed, ending a catastrophic leak that spilled 4.9 million barrels (779 million litres, or 311 Olympic-sized pools\u2019 worth) of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n \r\nThe disaster \u2013 which killed 11 people \u2013 was the largest marine oil spill in history, unleashing an environmental crisis that by some estimates harmed hundreds of thousands of marine animals and devastated coastal ecosystems. \r\n \r\nNow, as of September 2025, that legacy is being fiercely debated as the oil industry prepares to drill even deeper.\r\n \r\nWhy is BP returning to the Gulf?\r\nDespite the controversy, BP is ramping up its commercial ambition in the Gulf of Mexico again. \r\n \r\nThe company is developing Project Kaskida, a new deep-water well located 250 miles (402 km) from New Orleans, due to start production in 2029. \r\n \r\nWhen completed, Kaskida may produce 80,000 barrels of oil per day, with potential to access up to 10 billion barrels over its lifetime. It will be the Gulf\u2019s first major oil field since the Deepwater Horizon. \r\n \r\nThe project will require drilling deeper than the well that failed in 2010 \u2013 nearly 1,798 m to the bottom of the Gulf, then another 9,906 m in the rock. \r\n \r\nThis move is part of a bigger story: in the years since the Deepwater Horizon spill, the US became the world\u2019s top producer of crude oil in 2018, a mantle the country has held every year since.\r\n \r\nWhat drives the industry\u2019s high risk appetite?\r\nThe continued corporate focus on deep-water drilling highlights that the risk appetite of major oil firms remains high. This is driven by two key factors. \r\n \r\nFirst, these locations have long proven a rewarding frontier ground for oil exploration, with governments generally permitting firms to operate there. \r\n \r\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, the US government awarded the first new post-disaster deep-water drilling permit in March 2011, less than a year after the Deepwater Horizon spill began.\r\n \r\nSecond, the world\u2019s oil giants are highly resilient to wide-ranging international risks. \r\n \r\nTheir scale and profitability, despite fluctuations in oil prices, equip them to absorb major setbacks and respond quickly to new opportunities. Even after incurring tens of billions of dollars in costs and seeing its share price nearly halve in 2010, BP remains a dominant industry player.\r\n \r\nWhat are the main safety and political concerns?\r\nThe legacy of Deepwater Horizon, however, is much broader than the fate of one company.\r\n \r\nThe disaster received massive global attention, with an almost immediate regulatory and political backlash. Soon after the oil spill began, several countries including the US, Canada and Norway declared moratoriums on deep-water drilling.\r\n \r\nA decade and a half on, significant concerns continue to be voiced about the safety of deep-water drilling. Several Democratic members of the US Congress have written in collective opposition to the Kaskida project, calling it \u201can unacceptable threat to Gulf communities, ecosystems, and the climate\u201d.\r\n \r\nThe legislators highlight BP\u2019s own estimate that a worst-case scenario at Kaskida could release up to four million barrels \u2013 \u201ca disaster on par with, or exceeding, the Deepwater Horizon spill\u201d. They also claim that BP \u201cseverely underestimates the potential size and duration of a worst-case discharge\u201d.\r\n \r\nThis political concern is amplified by many non-governmental organisations too. Jackson Chiappinelli of Earthjustice, an environmental organisation opposed to the new BP project, asserts that \u201cthe deeper you go into the ocean to drill, the greater the risk of a spill\u201d.\r\n \r\nWhat are the long-term environmental and human costs?\r\nEvidence from other major spills indicates there can be long-term legacy on local ecosystems. A number of species still reportedly have not fully recovered from the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which spilled about 41.6 million litres of oil.\r\n \r\nThe University of South Florida asserts that multiple fish species have not fully recovered since Deepwater Horizon. The US National Wildlife Federation claims that the impact on wildlife is broader, noting that local dolphin populations, struggling with worsened lung disease and other health issues, could take decades to rebound.\r\n \r\nThe human cost is also still being measured. \r\n \r\nResearch from the US National Institute of Health on more than 30,000 workers in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill clean-up found they had an increased propensity for health problems including heart attacks, diabetes, rashes, and other skin conditions.\r\n \r\nSo what\u2019s next?\r\nIn this context, the pro-industry \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d mantra of the second Trump administration raises broad concerns. \r\n \r\nThe first is that while scientific and technological innovation can improve safety, completely risk-free drilling is unrealistic, given the remote and challenging nature of the work. \r\n \r\nThe second concern is that intense international focus on the Deepwater Horizon disaster and earlier ones such as Exxon Valdez can obscure a more chronic problem. \r\n \r\nSignificant spills occur regularly around the world with far less attention. A 2006 report concluded that Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta has experienced the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez leak every year for nearly 50 years.\r\n \r\nIt may have been 15 years since the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the controversy continues. In the absence of further major disasters in the near to mid-term future, deep-water drilling will likely remain a key part of the landscape for years to come.\r\n \r\nTrump\u2019s World Liberty token falls in first day of trading\r\n \r\nNEW YORK - The digital tokens backing the Trump family\u2019s cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, fell in value on Sept 1 in their first day of trading.\r\n \r\nThe World Liberty tokens, known as $WLFI, were sold to investors after the Trump family and its business partners in 2024 launched the venture, a decentralised finance platform that has also issued a stablecoin.\r\n \r\nInvestors in the tokens voted in July to make them tradable, paving the way for their sale and purchase - and potentially boosting the value of the president\u2019s holdings of them.\r\n \r\nEarly investors can sell up to 20 per cent of their holdings, World Liberty has said.\r\n \r\nThe tokens initially traded above US$0.30 (S$0.39) in their Sept 1 debut but later fell in price. They were down about 12 per cent at US$0.246 as of 6.40pm GMT (2.40am on Sept 2 in Singapore), according to CoinGecko data.\r\n \r\nThat gave the token a total market capitalisation of just below US$7 billion, making WLFI the 31st largest crypto token in circulation, CoinGecko data showed.\r\n \r\nSeveral of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, OKX and Bybit, are offering the tokens on their platforms.\r\n \r\nSince World Liberty\u2019s launch in 2024, the Trump family has made around US$500 million from the project, according to Reuters calculations based on the company\u2019s terms and conditions, transactions traced by crypto analysis firms, and publicly disclosed deals.\r\n \r\nThe tokens were not made tradable at their initial sale. Instead, they gave holders the right to vote on some changes to the business, such as its underlying code. Early investors have said the primary draw of $WLFI was the connection to Mr Trump and their expectations that the tokens would grow in value due to his backing.\r\n \r\nMaking the tokens tradable allows investors to determine their price, enabling speculation, earning trading fees for exchanges that list them, and likely stoking interest from a wider swath of crypto investors.\r\n \r\nWorld Liberty and Mr Trump\u2019s other crypto businesses have faced criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts who say the Trump family\u2019s forays into the cryptocurrency businesses, at the same time as the president reshapes the regulatory framework that governs digital currencies, represent profound conflicts of interest.\r\n \r\nThe White House has said repeatedly that Mr Trump\u2019s assets are in a trust managed by his children and that there are no conflicts of interest.

This should drive 20%-30% y/y revenue growth. We also expect profitability to improve due to 1) higher contributions from high-margin cross-border payment vs low-margin domestic payment 2) cost savings from economy of scales and technology application; and 3) narrowing losses in JVs, with core profit expected to break even in FY26F. </span></p><p class=\"NormalWeb \" style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"NormalWeb \"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-weight: bold;font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\">Recent share price pull-back as an entry point.</span><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\"> We believe further development of stablecoin in HK and improving profitability will be a key re-rating catalyst.

We also expect profitability to improve due to 1) higher contributions from high-margin cross-border payment vs low-margin domestic payment 2) cost savings from economy of scales and technology application; and 3) narrowing losses in JVs, with core profit expected to break even in FY26F. </span></p><p class=\"NormalWeb \" style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"NormalWeb \"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-weight: bold;font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\">Recent share price pull-back as an entry point.</span><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial';font-size: 13.3333333333333px;\"> We believe further development of stablecoin in HK and improving profitability will be a key re-rating catalyst.
