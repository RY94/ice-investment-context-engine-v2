Maintain BUY on JD for its higher-than-industry revenue growth and undemanding valuation, TP of HKD164/USD42.\r\n\r\nWhat we think: JD.com (9618 HK/JD US) announced its 2Q25 results on August 14, 2025, after the HK market close. Revenue grew 22.4% y/y to RMB356.7bn, 6% ahead of consensus estimates. Net product revenue grew 20.7% y/y to RMB282bn, with strong 23.4% y/y increase in electronics and home appliances revenue, while general merchandise revenue was up 16.4%. This was backed by the strong 618 season and trade-in initiatives. New Business revenue surged c.200% y/y to RMB13.9bn (much higher than estimates' RMB6.8bn), fueled by the expansion of JD Food Delivery business. However, the massive expansion in Food Delivery has caused operating loss in the new business segment widened significantly to RMB14.8bn (vs consensus estimates' RMB8.1bn). JD's non-GAAP net profit decreased by 49% y/y to RMB7.4bn in 2Q25, 24% ahead of consensus estimates.\r\n\r\nGiven 3Q25 is a Food Delivery high season with JD recording peak order volume in July, we expect fierce competition and heavy marketing spending to weigh on group profitability in 3Q25. We believe the launch of cross-selling using algorithms and systems in 3Q25, will further improve the conversion rate (percentage of food delivery users who also become JD retail users) from around 40% in June. Meanwhile, JD continues to return value to shareholders, buying back USD1.5bn worth of shares in 1H25 (c. 2.8% of shares outstanding as of end-FY24) under its current USD5bn buyback program. The stock is currently trading at 9x 12-month forward P/E, c.1 SD below its historical average. We maintain a BUY rating for JD on its solid core business momentum and undemanding valuation, TP of HKD164/USD42.\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's Events\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   10:00am - Manulife US REIT (MUST SP)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   11:00am - SF REIT (2191 HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   2:00pm - Nam Cheong (NCL SP)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   4:00pm - Dongguan Yiheda Automation (301029 CH) (Putonghua)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   4:00pm - 2Q25 Philippine Economic Insights (Expert call)\r\n\r\n\r\n18 August 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   10:00am - Prosperity REIT (808 HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   4:00pm - Lenovo Group (992 HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   SF REIT (2191 HK) NDR (1x1 Virtual / Physical in HK)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick here<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/corporateaccess> to see all of our upcoming corporate and analyst access events!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMER\r\nFirst Resources: Stellar performance in 2Q25\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DC0DCC.EFCA8A30]<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/api/s3/dbs-buffer/article_attachment/20250814/FR14Aug2025.pdf>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   2Q25 was ahead of our and consensus estimates, supported by positive impact from the ANJT acquisition\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Announced interim dividend of 4.5 SCts/share (36% dividend payout) (1H24: 3.5 Scts/shr)\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Maintain BUY with TP of S$2\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we think: 1H25 earnings came in at USD152m (+67.8% y/y), forming 87%/70% of DBS/consensus FY25F earnings estimates of USD200m (-5% y/y)/USD244m (flat y/y). The ANJT acquisition has proven to be positive for FR, delivering a quick and tangible impact - a testament to the management team's strong execution. CPO production rose to 510k MT (+18.6% y/y) in 1H25 while total harvested fresh fruit bunches (FFB) reached 2.0m MT (+23% y/y) in 2Q25. Overall productivity metrics improved, with FFB yield rising to 9.6 MT/ha (+14.3% y/y) and a relatively stable extraction rate of 21.7% versus 1H24's 22.3%.\r\n\r\nGiven the smooth integration with ANJT, coupled with a positive CPO price outlook in 2H25, we believe FR could sustain its earnings momentum into the second half of the year. We see upside risk to our forecasts if FR maintains this smooth transition into 2H25. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of SGD2.00, which implies an FY26F PE of 12.7x, or +2 SD above its historical PE multiple. We believe FR deserves a valuation re-rating post-acquisition, supported by a strong CPO price trend in 2H25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIALS\r\nAirports of Thailand: Speculation on PSC raise priced in\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DC0DCC.EFCA8A30]<https://researchwise.dbsvresearch.com/ResearchManager/DownloadResearch.aspx?E=ighdbkhaf>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Downgrade from HOLD to FULLY VALUED considering AOT's rich valuation with limited earnings growth\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   3QFY25F core profit soft after weaker tourist numbers and duty-free area reclamation in 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Potential PSC hike priced in after recent share price rally; Downgrade to Fully Valued with higher TP of THB32\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we think:  AOT 3QFY25 core profit came in at THB3.72bn (-15% y/y, -24% q/q) - in line with market expectations.  We see AOT moving into the low season in 4QFY25F. In July 2025, inbound tourism continued to contract 16% y/y; we expect slow recovery throughout the quarter. The seasonality impact should see revenue drop both y/y and q/q. Y/y, the company will also face the impact of duty-free area reclamation after inbound duty free ceased operations. Overall, earnings in 4Q25F should be the softest in FY25F.\r\n\r\nThe recent rally in share price has pushed AOT's FY26 PE multiple to 32.3x. We believe the current valuation has already priced in the potential PSC increase of around THB100 (as reported by local media), leaving limited short- to medium-term upside. For Nantika's DCF-based valuation, she has rolled forward her estimates to FY26F and adopted a more optimistic terminal growth rate of 2.0%, up from 1.5% previously. As a result, our TP has increased from THB28.00 to THB32.00, suggesting 17% downside from current level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image004.jpg@01DC0DCC.EFCA8A30]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHK/CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Geely Automobile (175 HK): A strong 1H25 results despite keen market competition - ID<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295871263?source=landing&pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=27301>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (1038 HK): Favourable resets ahead - ID<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295871038?source=landing&pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=27303>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Sino Land Co Ltd (83 HK): Company Update: Returning to acquisition mode - ID<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR4295870829?source=landing&pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=27304>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Regional Metal: Trump adjusts copper imports tariffs, negative to copper prices in near term and to narrow price gap between COMEX and LME - ID<https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/industry/IN40eac58e707b58088b56a28fadb9bbf5?source=landing&pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=26833>\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Lenovo Group Ltd (992 HK): 1QFY3/26 earnings beat;

Revenue grew 22.4% y/y to RMB356.7bn, 6% ahead of consensus\r\n estimates. Net product revenue grew 20.7% y/y to RMB282bn, with strong 23.4% y/y increase in electronics and home appliances revenue, while general merchandise revenue was up 16.4%. This was backed by the strong 618 season and trade-in initiatives.</span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">New Business revenue surged c.200% y/y to RMB13.9bn (much higher than estimates' RMB6.8bn), fueled by the expansion of JD Food Delivery business. However,\r\n the massive expansion in Food Delivery has caused operating loss in the new business segment widened significantly to RMB14.8bn (vs consensus estimates' RMB8.1bn). JD&#8217;s non-GAAP net profit decreased by 49% y/y to RMB7.4bn in 2Q25, 24% ahead of consensus estimates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:16.8pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:16.8pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">Given 3Q25 is a Food Delivery high season with JD recording peak order volume in July, we expect fierce competition and heavy marketing spending to weigh on group\r\n profitability in 3Q25. We believe the launch of cross-selling using algorithms and systems in 3Q25, will further improve the conversion rate (percentage of food delivery users who also become JD retail users) from around 40% in June. Meanwhile, JD continues\r\n to return value to shareholders, buying back USD1.5bn worth of shares in 1H25 (c. 2.8% of shares outstanding as of end-FY24) under its current USD5bn buyback program. The stock is currently trading at 9x 12-month forward P/E, c.1 SD below its historical average.\r\n We maintain a BUY rating for JD on its solid core business momentum and undemanding valuation, TP of HKD164/USD42.</span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"204\" valign=\"top\"

of DBS/consensus FY25F earnings estimates of USD200m (-5% y/y)/USD244m (flat y/y). The ANJT acquisition has proven to be positive for FR, delivering a quick and tangible impact &#8212; a testament to the management team&#8217;s strong execution.\r\n CPO production rose to 510k MT (&#43;18.6% y/y) in 1H25 while total harvested fresh fruit bunches (FFB) reached 2.0m MT (&#43;23% y/y) in 2Q25. Overall productivity metrics improved, with FFB yield rising to 9.6 MT/ha (&#43;14.3% y/y) and a relatively stable extraction\r\n rate of 21.7% versus 1H24&#8217;s 22.3%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">Given the smooth integration with ANJT, coupled with a positive CPO price outlook in 2H25, we believe FR could sustain its earnings momentum into the second half\r\n of the year. We see upside risk to our forecasts if FR maintains this smooth transition into 2H25. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of SGD2.00, which implies an FY26F PE of 12.7x, or &#43;2 SD above its historical PE multiple. We believe FR deserves a valuation\r\n re-rating post-acquisition, supported by a strong CPO price trend in 2H25.</span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:12.45pt\">\r\n<td width=\"601\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:450.8pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:12.45pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:15.0pt\">\r\n<td width=\"292\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:218.65pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:15.0pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">INDUSTRIALS<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:#C00000;mso-ligatures:none\">Airports of Thailand: Speculation on PSC raise priced in<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><a href=\"https://researchwise.dbsvresearch.com/ResearchManager/DownloadResearch.aspx?E=ighdbkhaf\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:windowtext;mso-ligatures:none;text-decoration:none\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"77\" height=\"26\" style=\"width:.802in;height:.2708in\" id=\"_x0000_i1029\" src=\"cid:image003.png@01DC0DCC.EFCA8A30\"></span></a><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"310\" colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:232.15pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:15.0pt\">\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">Downgrade from HOLD to FULLY VALUED considering AOT&#8217;s rich valuation with limited earnings growth\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">3QFY25F core profit soft after weaker tourist numbers and duty-free area reclamation in 2024\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:-18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;line-height:115%;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">Potential PSC hike priced in after recent share price rally; Downgrade to Fully Valued with higher TP of THB32<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height:12.45pt\">\r\n<td width=\"601\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:450.8pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;height:12.45pt\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:115%\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:115%\">\r\n<b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">What we think:</span></b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ligatures:none\">&nbsp; AOT 3QFY25 core profit came in\r\n at THB3.72bn (-15% y/y, -24% q/q) &#8211; in line with market expectations.&nbsp; We see AOT moving into the low season in 4QFY25F.

        "body": "Summary:\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, China's best robotaxi player (in terms of the algo /\r\nmodel). Aims to be gross margin break even on robotaxi operations by end\r\n2025 or (if delayed) 1Q26e. Call fleshes out some details behind the current\r\nadvancements in robotaxi tech. More for read through on China's robotaxi and\r\nLIDAR industry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIPO 27 Nov 2024 at $13/ ADR. At $17.095 / share, market cap is at US$5.96bn\r\n& EV is US$6.92b. 2024E revenue US$74.67m and PATMI of -145m. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFY24e EV/Sales of 92.7x.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBusiness Description:\r\n\r\nFounded in 2016, in Silicon Valley, Pony.ai has quickly become a global\r\nleader in autonomous mobility and is a pioneer in extending autonomous\r\nmobility technologies and services at a rapidly expanding footprint of sites\r\naround the world. Operating Robotaxi, Robotruck and Personally Owned Vehicle\r\n(POV) business units, Pony.ai is an industry leader in the commercialisation\r\nof autonomous driving. In 2022, Pony.ai became the first autonomous company\r\nto receive a licence to operate its self-driving taxis in China.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompany Update Group Conference Call\r\n\r\nGeorge Shao (Senior Director - Financing, Investment and Strategy)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGross margin positive on robotaxi operation by the end of 2025. If we can\r\nbreakeven on robotaxi operation, not on licensing or robotruck etc. If we\r\ncan do this right in Tier 1 cities, we can duplicate in other cities. To hit\r\n50 - 100k fleet size, there will be a need to be heavily reliant on renting\r\ncars (to be asset light) and running them as robotaxis. His calculations is\r\nat a fleet size of 30-50k Pony.ai's robotaxis in tier 1 cities, they can\r\nreach group level profitability at the net income or free cash flow level.\r\nPony.ai plans to run 600 robotaxis by end of 2025 vs 100 in 2024.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Robotaxi operation will enable us to maximise the max revenue and profits\r\nwe will get - not by selling the software / hardware. ADAS don't make money\r\nhere or anywhere in the world. Any software L2 is L3 in my mind - they both\r\nrequire a driver. People don't pay anything to OEM for subscription based\r\nmodel so OEM don't pay a lot to tier 1 software companies. In China, tier 1\r\nsoftware companies cannot make money. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you charge people for mileage, carry passenger, then you can make money.\r\nWe are laser focused on 1 thing right - robotaxi operation, making money by\r\nmileage. We are focused on tier 1 cities.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLicense to operate Robotaxis in Tier 1 cities: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlans to mass produce with Beijing auto and Guangzhou auto in 2025 - vehicle\r\ncoming down from production line in June 2025. After which, it takes 2\r\nmonths to get the license as this is their 7th generation robotaxis before\r\ntaking passengers in September. Their 5/6th generation ones are already\r\nlicensed previously. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPony.ai is the only driverless player in China to get the licenses from all\r\ntier 1 cities. Weride & Baidu are not able to do so. You can only get the\r\npermit if you prove that your safety / speed on the road is adequate amongst\r\nmany other things. Weride & Baidu robotaxis drives slowly and blocks traffic\r\n+ their AI isn't as good compared to us. Their autonomous driving is by\r\nremotely driving the vehicle instead of remotely assisting the vehicle (they\r\nhave an operator behind a steering wheel whereas Pony's operators use a\r\nmouse to choose how to rectify issues and the car will reverse etc and\r\ndecide how much to turn, how far back to reverse on its own). Our operator\r\nonly sees 12 screens, he will see if there's any input needed, he can even\r\ndeny assisting the vehicle. No one is holding a steering wheel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was mentioning about this picture where PM Lee visited WeRide where\r\nthere's operators behind steering wheels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nL2/L3 vs L4\r\n\r\nDr Tiancheng Lou (CTO and Co-founder Pony.ai) has done a lot of interviews\r\nwith Chinese reporters. In summary, the better you do on L2/L3, the further\r\naway you are from L4. BYD, Nio, XPeng etc the L2/L3 companies, their\r\nmethodology is to learn from human data, to sell as many cars as possible\r\nand learn from them. You can develop very quickly by learning from human\r\napproach but there is an upper limit to it where you can't surpass the human\r\nbeing in terms of safety etc. Pony.ai realized this 5/6 years ago and they\r\ndon't learn form humans, but instead via practice. Reinforced learning\r\ninstead of imitation learning. Pony.ai establishes the work model by\r\nthemselves, to train and drive itself. \"If you don't surpass human, you\r\ncan't run robotaxi\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Deepseek of autonomous driving\"\r\n\r\nPony.ai uses less powerful chips to do better things. Compared to waymo, we\r\nuse L2 kinda chips to do L4 things. Google waymo still uses 2 H100 chips in\r\nthe trunk of their vehicle (super expensive, a lot of computing power).\r\nPony.ai uses NVIDIA Orin-X chips (40/50 times cheaper than the H100s) as our\r\nalgo is better than theirs. Even for LIDAR, we can use L2 lidars to do L4.\r\nFor L4 lidars, the point cloud is much denser, quality much higher, distance\r\nlonger than L2 lidars. A L4 lidar by waymo is >$10k each. The lidar that\r\nPony.ai uses are the auto grade lidar (the same as Li Auto or Xpeng etc),\r\nits Hesai AT128s, 2-3k rmb each. Waymo has 1 collusion every 30/40k miles,\r\nPony.ai is 150k miles. Waymo burns 2.5-3bn usd a year, Pony.ai burns 100m\r\nusd a year. A lot of investors say we are the deepseek of autonomous\r\ndriving, using way less complicated hardware to accomplish a lot more. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCost per robotaxi / density of taxis\r\n\r\nToday, our mass produced vehicle, lidar chips sensors plus car, is 280k rmb\r\n/ car. This is 7x lower than waymo. Say if we can get 10s of thousands of\r\nvehicles, we can lower that price by a third, which translates to lower\r\ndepreciation or rent on the vehicle. We are doing robotaxi operation, each\r\nvehicle revenue depends on density of the robotaxi that you deploy in a\r\ncity. The average didi driver in China if he is a full time driver in a Tier\r\n1 city who drives 14-16 hours a day, he can get 30 orders a day or more.\r\nToday pony gets 10-20 a day (in the same Tier 1 cities). The China national\r\naverage is 10/15 level. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMarket need for taxis\r\n\r\nEvery 10k people in tier 1 cities needs 400 ride hailing cars. Regardless of\r\nrobotaxi or didi. This means that every 2 million population needs 80k ride\r\nhailing cars. Every district in a Tier 1 city has 2m people, each city has\r\nat least 10 districts. (He is implying that each of the Tier 1 city requires\r\n800k ride hailing cars for a total of maybe 3+m vehicles amongst the 4 Tier\r\n1 cities). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

Weride &amp; Baidu robotaxis drives slowly and blocks traffic + their AI isn&#8217;t as good compared to us. Their autonomous driving is by remotely driving the vehicle instead of remotely assisting the vehicle (they have an operator behind a steering wheel whereas Pony&#8217;s operators use a mouse to choose how to rectify issues and the car will reverse etc and decide how much to turn, how far back to reverse on its own). Our operator only sees 12 screens, he will see if there&#8217;s any input needed, he can even deny assisting the vehicle.

In summary, the better you do on L2/L3, the further away you are from L4. BYD, Nio, XPeng etc the L2/L3 companies, their methodology is to learn from human data, to sell as many cars as possible and learn from them. You can develop very quickly by learning from human approach but there is an upper limit to it where you can&#8217;t surpass the human being in terms of safety etc. Pony.ai realized this 5/6 years ago and they don&#8217;t learn form humans, but instead via practice. Reinforced learning instead of imitation learning. Pony.ai establishes the work model by themselves, to train and drive itself. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t surpass human, you can&#8217;t run robotaxi&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN'>&#8220;Deepseek of autonomous driving&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN'>Pony.ai uses less powerful chips to do better things.

Pony.ai uses NVIDIA Orin-X chips (40/50 times cheaper than the H100s) as our algo is better than theirs. Even for LIDAR, we can use L2 lidars to do L4. For L4 lidars, the point cloud is much denser, quality much higher, distance longer than L2 lidars. A L4 lidar by waymo is &gt;$10k each. The lidar that Pony.ai uses are the auto grade lidar (the same as Li Auto or Xpeng etc), its Hesai AT128s, 2-3k rmb each. Waymo has 1 collusion every 30/40k miles, Pony.ai is 150k miles. Waymo burns 2.5-3bn usd a year, Pony.ai burns 100m usd a year.

We are doing robotaxi operation, each vehicle revenue depends on density of the robotaxi that you deploy in a city. The average didi driver in China if he is a full time driver in a Tier 1 city who drives 14-16 hours a day, he can get 30 orders a day or more.
