Small, mid-cap stocks ride MAS liquidity boost
FTSE ST Mid and Small Cap Index rises 9% in third quarter of FY2025 to =
Aug
12, from 1.8% in first half of fiscal year
=20
[SINGAPORE] The Republic=92s small and mid-cap stocks are gaining fresh
momentum, buoyed by initiatives from the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) to deepen the equity market and broaden investor participation.
=20
On Jul 21, MAS announced it will inject S$5 billion into Singapore =
equities
through its Equity Market Development Plan (EQDP). The first tranche =96 =
a
combined S$1.1 billion =96 was allocated to Fullerton Fund Management, =
JP
Morgan Asset Management and Avanda Investment Management.
=20
These measures are already showing results, said analysts. Smaller =
counters,
long overshadowed by large caps, are attracting institutional flows and
trading at stronger valuations as liquidity improves.
=20
According to data from Singapore Exchange (SGX), the FTSE ST Mid and =
Small
Cap Index rose 9 per cent in the third quarter of FY2025 to Aug 12, =
compared
to just 1.8 per cent in the first half of the fiscal year.=20
=20
It also outpaced the blue-chip Straits Times Index, which rose 7 per =
cent
over the same period.=20
=20
The FTSE ST Mid and Small Cap Index, which tracks 74 constituents with a
combined market capitalisation of S$176 billion, recorded S$382 million =
in
net institutional inflows in Q3. Almost half of the increase =96 or some =
S$180
million =96 flowed into eight technology stocks, led by iFast, Frencken,
Venture, UMS and Valuetronics.
=20
Liquidity boost from MAS=20
Analysts say the EQDP has drawn stronger institutional interest to =
smaller
names.=20
=20
=93The MAS=92 EQDP has provided a structural boost to the Singapore =
equity
market by drawing stronger institutional interest toward small and =
mid-cap
stocks,=94 said Joel Phua, research analyst at FSMOne Singapore.
=20
He added: =93These inflows =96 even if not very large =96 can have an =
outsized
impact on small-cap prices, given their thinner liquidity.=94
=20
On a macro level, the lower interest rate environment is also =93very
positive=94 for small and mid-cap stocks as they tend to be leveraged =
higher,
said David Poh, head of investment and ESG strategies for South Asia at
asset manager Amundi.=20
=20
Investors are turning to small and mid-cap names for higher returns, now
that large caps are already fully valued, added Poh.
=20
Companies with strong fundamentals and clear revenue outlooks have =
already
experienced notable price re-ratings, with price-to-earning (PE) ratios
above their 10-year averages, said Phua of FSMOne.=20
=20
For example, UMS=92 current PE ratio is 23.9, almost double its 10-year
average of 12.7, while Frencken=92s PE ratio is 15.7, higher than its =
10-year
average of 11.6.
=20
Signs of improved sentiment are visible in the market.=20
=20
Terence Wong, chief executive officer of fund management company Azure
Capital, said that recent financial results briefings of small and =
mid-cap
companies are =93a lot more crowded=94 with more analysts and media =
attending.
=93Companies are also receiving a lot more enquiries from investors,=94 =
he
added.
=20
Share placement exercises are picking up too, with more companies =
feeling
confident about raising funds now that their valuations have risen, said
Wong.
=20
For example, Sanli Environmental, which has a market capitalisation of =
S$70
million, announced its first share placement since listing in 2017, =
issuing
33.3 million new shares at S$0.12 each. The placement was fully taken =
up.
=20
Sectors driving gains
Technology stocks have emerged as favourites among institutional =
investors.
=20
Phua said that small and mid-cap stocks in the industrials and the
technology sub-sectors have observed higher returns due to strong =
financial
results in the first half of FY2025 and healthy order books.=20
=20
Poh also sees opportunities in technology, adding that there are a few =
tech
companies in Singapore that allow investors to be exposed to artificial
intelligence, but without the volatility of foreign exchange and high
valuations seen in other markets.
=20
=93These companies have very strong fundamentals, healthy balance =
sheets, and
pay good dividend yields,=94 said Poh.
=20
Property, construction and commodity sectors are also leading the growth =
of
small cap companies due to a combination of strong earnings and improved
liquidity from the EQDP, added Paul Chew, the head of research at =
Phillip
Securities Research.=20
=20
Can the party last?=20
Phua believes that the current interest in small and mid-cap stocks =
could
continue into early 2026, supported by subsequent deployments of EQDP =
funds.
=20
However, global macro shocks, such as renewed tariff pressures, could =
pose
challenges, as smaller companies are likely to be more vulnerable to =
such
headwinds.=20
=20
Small caps, which offer higher returns, can also experience sharper =
price
swings than larger names if investment flows reverse due to their lower
liquidity and higher volatility, he added.
=20
Ultimately, investors will have to pick stocks with good fundamentals, =
said
analysts.
=20
Wong of Azure Capital said that while some investors have previously =
been
forced to sell their shares at a discount due to illiquidity, astute
investors can pick good stocks where the dividends cover the entire cost =
of
their investment, with any additional earnings as bonus.=20
8PR ASIA
=91Undervalued=92 CapitaLand Ascott Trust presses on with =
diversification for
stability and growth
Lodging trust has a tested playbook of operating in a spread of =
geographies
and asset classes with disciplined capital management
=20
[SINGAPORE] The share price of CapitaLand Ascott Trust (Clas) =96 the =
largest
lodging trust in the Asia-Pacific by total assets =96 is undervalued, =
said
Serena Teo, the chief executive officer of the managers of the stapled
group.=20
=20
=93Today, we trade at just under 0.8 times to book, and we=92re offering =
a
distribution yield of a high 6 per cent,=94 she said.
=20
The S$0.885 closing price for the counter on Friday (Aug 29) is 79 per =
cent
of the S$1.12 net asset value per stapled security as at Jun 30, 2025. =
The
price also reflects 6.9 per cent distribution yield based on the S$0.061
distribution per stapled security (DPS) for the financial year ended Dec =
31,
2024.
=20
Teo, who became CEO of Clas=92 managers in June 2022, has put her money =
where
her mouth is.
=20
Last year, she received 38 per cent of her total remuneration of S$1.16
million in Clas stapled securities. In February this year, she bought
500,000 stapled securities at S$0.895 each, amounting to S$447,500. This
raised her direct interest in Clas to 0.018 per cent from 0.005 per =
cent.
=20
Teo said Clas=92 market capitalisation, at close to S$3.4 billion, is
=93probably what=92s preventing us from being in the Straits Times Index =
(STI)=94,
when asked what it would take for the counter to be included in the
benchmark index. =93If the share price recovers to a level that is =
closer to
the book value/NAV (net asset value), the market cap will go up=85 I =
think
that would be when we=92ll be able to enter the STI,=94 she added.=20
=20
Clas began life as Ascott Residence Trust (ART), which was floated on =
the
Singapore Exchange in 2006 as the first pan-Asian serviced residence =
real
estate investment trust (Reit) with an initial portfolio value of S$856
million comprising 12 assets with more than 2,000 units in Singapore, =
China,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.=20
=20
In late 2019, ART merged with Ascendas Hospitality Trust (AHT), a =
stapled
group comprising a Reit and a business trust.
=20
The combined entity, a stapled group, retained the ART name.
=20
CapitaLand Ascott Trust acquires three rental housing properties in =
Japan
for 4 billion yen
In September 2022, ART was renamed Clas.
=20
Clas=92 portfolio currently comprises serviced residences, hotels, =
rental
housing and student accommodation across 104 properties with more than
19,000 units in 45 cities in 16 countries including Singapore, =
Australia,
Japan, France, the UK and the US.
=20
Out of the total portfolio value of about S$8 billion, hospitality =
assets
(serviced residences and hotels) have a 83 per cent share; rental =
housing
and student accommodation (or the living sector) account for the balance =
17
per cent.
=20
The group=92s mid-term target is to grow the living sector share to =
25-30 per
cent of portfolio value, with the balance 70-75 per cent in hospitality
assets.
=20
Sometimes misunderstood
=93I think some people still feel that Clas is a hospitality-only type =
of
portfolio. And there is a view that, compared with other asset classes, =
the
revenue streams of hospitality products are seasonal and volatile,=94 =
noted
Teo.
=20
However, she said that Clas offers a =93distinct value proposition of
combining stability with growth=94.
=20
Clas=92 living sector assets as well as management contracts with =
minimum
guaranteed income (MGI) and master leases on some of its hospitality =
assets
provide a stable income stream, which accounted for 66 per cent of =
Clas=92 H1
2025 gross profit of S$182.5 million.
=20
 =93This strengthens our portfolio resilience through market cycles,
insulating Clas from seasonal fluctuations in the hospitality trade,=94 =
said
Teo.
=20
=93On the other hand, our hospitality assets that are on management =
contracts
(without MGI) enable us to capture upside from the strong travel =
demand,=94
she added. This is the growth income part of Clas=92 business, which =
accounted
for the balance 34 per cent of the gross profit in H1 2025.
=20
Growing investor interest in lodging
Asked about the potential competition to Clas from the expected listings =
of
Centurion Accommodation Reit (which will hold purpose-built worker
accommodation and purpose-built student accommodation assets) and the
Coliwoo Group co-living business on the SGX, Teo said the planned =
flotations
are in tandem with growing investor interest in lodging assets; this is =
also
a bright spot for Clas.
=20
Lodging assets beckon investors with strong sector fundamentals, =
underpinned
by evolving mobility trends and growing living sector demand, Teo noted.
=93With investors recognising the growth potential of the lodging =
sector, we
expect more liquidity as they seek quality investment opportunities,=94 =
she
added.
=20
=93With almost 20 years of experience, Clas has grown to be the largest
lodging trust in Asia-Pacific. Our global scale, diversification across
geographies, asset classes and contract types, and support by our strong
sponsor CapitaLand Investment set Clas apart from others,=94 said Teo.
=20
The lodging asset classes that the stapled group has exposure to, cater =
to
varying durations of stay =96 from the shorter stay of hotels to a =
slightly
longer stay of serviced residences, followed by student accommodation =
and
rental housing. =20
=20
Leases at Clas=92 26 rental housing properties, all in Japan, are =
typically
for two years. For student accommodation, the lease duration is =
typically
for an academic year.=20
=20
The longer-stay properties add stability and resilience to the =
portfolio,
said Teo. =93Our average length of stay in the entire portfolio comes in =
at
about two months. It=92s quite different from a portfolio that is fully
hotel.=94=20
=20
Clas=92 eight student accommodation assets in the US serve universities =
where
90 per cent of students, on a blended basis, are domestic.
=20
=93For whatever reason, if the international student demand is affected,
there=92s more than sufficient domestic demand to replace the =
international
demand,=94 said Teo.
=20
Scale opens doors
While Teo does not have a target portfolio size for Clas, she =
acknowledges
that size does matter.
=20
Following the merger with AHT, the trust had sufficient scale to be =
included
in the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series (Global =
Developed
Index) in June 2020.
=20
That opened the door for Clas to have access to global investors, =
boosting
trading liquidity in the counter. In 2024, the average daily trading =
volume
for Clas stapled securities was about seven million.
=20
=93When you have a certain size, there are better economies of scale. =
There=92s
also better diversification, investor awareness and lender support,=94 =
said
Teo.
=20
Tested playbook
=93We have demonstrated a track record of creating value for stapled =
security
holders through strategic portfolio reconstitution and timely =
redeployment
of divestment proceeds into DPS-accretive opportunities.=94 These =
include
embarking on higher-yielding acquisitions and asset enhancement =
initiatives
(AEIs) and paring down high-interest debt.
=20
=93Since the start of 2024, we have divested more than S$500 million =
worth of
properties and completed acquisitions of about S$560 million. And the
acquisitions are all DPS accretive,=94 said Teo.
=20

OCBC maintains $8.90 fair value on ST Engineering, on sustained defence
spending and other growth drivers
=20
ST Engineering shares dropped by some 14% after its 1HFY2025 results a
fortnight ago.
=20
Even so, OCBC Investment Research remains bullish on this stock, keeping =
its
"buy" call and target price as the company's fundamentals remain and its
year to date share price gain of some 60% is deemed to have more legs.
=20
"The recent share price pullback appears driven by profit-taking after =
its
strong sector outperformance, which is a trend also observed among other
global defence names as some investors trimmed positions," says OCBC in =
its
Aug 29 note.
=20
"Optimism around a potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire also played a =
role."
=20
From OCBC's point of view, its 1HFY2025 report card is "solid", with
earnings up 19.7% y-o-y to $402.8 million.
=20
Besides its "meaningful" exposure to defence-related manufacturing which =
is
currently in a multi-year defence spending upcycle, ST Engineering's
integrated aerospace lifecycle fleet solutions enable better capture of
maintenance, repair and overhaul spend.
=20
The continued ramp-up of its passenger-to-freighter conversion business =
will
support growth as well.
=20
The company's order book has reached $31.2 billion as of June 30, an
increase of 18% y-o-y, with about $5 billion expected to be delivered in =
the
remainder of the year. Around a third of the contracts are =
defence-related.
=20
"This provides strong revenue visibility and underpins management=92s
confidence in execution for the rest of 2025," says OCBC.
=20
The brokerage adds that ST Engineering is to be seen as a =
"differentiated"
name versus its peers, thanks to its strong earnings visibility, a solid
orderbook, and tailwinds across aerospace and defence.
=20
"The company=92s long-term growth story remains intact, underpinned by
structural drivers of higher defence spending globally.
=20
"Many nations also face ageing defence systems, pointing to sustained, =
not
temporary, demand. Even if the Ukraine war ends, defence spending is =
likely
to stay elevated. Our fair value estimate is unchanged at $8.90."

Retail S-Reits see lower cost of debt and positive rental reversions as
retail sales improve
=20
[singapore] Seven Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts =
(S-Reits)
with local retail assets have posted mixed results in revenue and net
property income. Retail S-Reits=92 debt costs fell with lower interest =
rates,
while rising consumer traffic drove positive rental reversions.
=20
The seven are: CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +0.88% =
(CICT),
Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +0.43% (FCT), Lendlease Global =
Commercial
Reit : JYEU 0% (LReit), Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU =
+0.73%
(MPACT), OUE Reit : TS0U 0%, Starhill Global Reit : P40U 0% and Suntec =
Reit
: T82U +0.76%. Here is a look at their recent business updates and
financials:
=20
CICT
CICT reported a 0.5 per cent dip in revenue and 0.4 per cent decline in =
net
property income (NPI) for the first half of 2025, mainly due to the sale =
of
21 Collyer Quay. Excluding that property, both would have risen by 1.4 =
and
1.7 per cent, respectively. Distribution per unit (DPU) rose 3.5 per =
cent to
S$0.0562. Capital management improved, with leverage and debt costs =
reduced
to 37.9 and 3.4 per cent, respectively.=20
=20
Portfolio occupancy remained steady at 96.3 per cent, down just 0.1 per =
cent
quarter on quarter. Rental reversions grew by 4.8 per cent for office =
and
7.7 per cent for retail, as tenant sales grew 17.9 per cent year on year
(yoy).
=20
CICT also raised S$600 million through a private placement to acquire =
the
remaining 55 per cent stake it does not own in CapitaSpring. The deal =
was
4.9 times oversubscribed at S$2.11 per unit and is expected to be DPU
accretive, reinforcing the Reit=92s focus on core domestic assets.
=20
FCT
FCT recorded a committed occupancy rate of 99.9 per cent in the third
quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 0.4 per cent compared with =
the
previous quarter. Shopper traffic rose by 2.1 per cent, and tenants=92 =
sales
increased by 4.4 per cent yoy.=20
=20
Capital management showed mixed results: aggregate leverage went up by =
0.8
per cent to 40.4 per cent with perpetual securities, while cost of debt =
fell
by 0.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent. The Reit=92s Hougang Mall began asset
enhancement initiative works in April 2025, reaching approximately 74 =
per
cent leasing pre-commitment with new concepts introduced to the mall.
=20
LReit
LReit posted a 1.9 per cent rise in revenue and 2.7 per cent in NPI for =
H2
FY2025. DPU grew 1.8 per cent to S$0.0180 for the half year. The Reit
expects a more favourable interest rate outlook to contribute positively
towards distribution performance.=20
=20
Its cost of debt stood at 3.46 per cent per annum, while interest =
coverage
ratio improved to 1.6 times. Earlier in August, LReit entered into an
agreement to divest the office component of commercial-retail =
development
Jem for S$462 million, which will strengthen the Reit=92s capital =
structure.
=20
MPACT
MPACT=92s revenue and NPI fell in Q1 FY2026, largely due to the =
strategic
divestment of Mapletree Anson and lower overseas contributions. DPU fell =
3.8
per cent to S$0.0201. Occupancy dipped slightly to 89.3 per cent, but =
rental
reversion was positive at 1.4 per cent, with VivoCity leading with a =
14.7
per cent uplift.=20
=20
In July 2025, MPACT announced the proposed divestment of two non-core
Japanese properties for 8.7 billion yen (S$78.7 million). This =
transaction
aligns with the manager=92s ongoing strategy to enhance portfolio =
quality and
focus on core assets.
=20
OUE Reit
OUE Reit=92s Mandarin Gallery recorded a committed occupancy rate of 99 =
per
cent and rental reversion of 34.3 per cent in Q2 2025. The average =
passing
rents for the property increased by 2.7 per cent to S$22.22 per square =
foot
per month, compared to Orchard Road retail rents=92 growth of 0.5 per =
cent.
The Reit collaborated with several partners to introduce new experiences =
at
the shopping mall, including a partnership with Pop Mart which featured
Labubu.
=20
Starhill Global Reit
Starhill Global Reit posted a 0.7 per cent yoy rise in revenue and
maintained steady NPI in H2 FY2025. DPU held at S$0.0185. Retail =
portfolio
committed occupancy was at 97.3 per cent, with Singapore properties =
fully
leased. In FY2025, Wisma Atria Property=92s shopper traffic rose 5 per =
cent
yoy, though tenant sales fell 5.2 per cent. Aggregate leverage remained =
at
36 per cent and average debt maturity was 3.1 years.
=20
Suntec Reit
Suntec Reit saw revenue and NPI rise by 3.3 per cent and 5.6 per cent,
respectively, in H1 2025, driven by a one-off compensation in Sydney,
Australia, and stronger performance in Singapore. DPU grew 3.7 per cent =
to
S$0.03155.=20
=20
Suntec City mall recorded rental reversion of 18 per cent for the half =
year,
despite a slight drop in shopper traffic and tenant sales. The Reit =
expects
retail sales to stay subdued amid cautious consumer spending, but Suntec
City mall should maintain over 95 per cent occupancy, due to strong =
tourism
and Mice (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) activity. =
While
positive rent reversions are likely, they may ease in FY2025 given =
economic
uncertainties. sgx research

iFast
On Aug 21, iFast chairman and group CEO Lim Chung Chun acquired 60,000

S$497,100, this increased his total interest in the global digital =
banking

by
iFast Financial in 2001. He subsequently led the group=92s expansion =
into Hong
Kong, Malaysia, China and the UK, building a fintech ecosystem across =
these
five markets.
=20
For the six months ended Jun 30, 2025, iFast reported S$50.4 million in
profit before tax, a 32.7 per cent surge from that in the year-ago =
period.
=20
Its UK-based iFast Global Bank (iGB) delivered a S$1.7 million profit in =
the
half year, reversing a S$3.8 million loss in H1 FY2024, after becoming
profitable in Q4 FY2024.=20
=20
The group acquired the fully licensed UK bank in March 2022, and =
immediately
focused on building its digital transaction banking business and =
integrating
it across the ecosystem.
=20
Supported by continued customer acquisition and deposit-taking, iGB =
customer
deposits grew 177.9 per cent in 2024 to =A3593.5 million (around S$1 =
billion)
and rose further to =A3828.7 million as at Jun 30, 2025.=20
=20
In addition to higher net interest revenue, iGB=92s net revenue was =
boosted by
stronger non-interest commission and fee income, which grew 81.7 per =
cent
year on year in H1 FY2025.
=20
The unit incorporates three core business lines: digital personal =
banking
(DPB), digital transaction banking (DTB) and the EzRemit platform.=20
=20
EzRemit is the remittance business of iGB, and provides remittance =
services
to business-to-business partners. It was extended and integrated within =
the
iGB app for DPB clients in 2024.=20
=20
EzRemit offers a fully integrated cross-border payments solution for =
money
transfers and foreign exchange across more than 20 currencies, a robust
query management system, and dynamic payout routing.
=20
The group noted in April in that iGB faces no regulatory or internal =
caps on
deposit growth and, as a fully digital bank, can scale without reliance =
on
physical branches. It added that leveraging the group=92s fintech =
ecosystem,
iGB aims to deploy innovative solutions and automation to reduce costs,
enhance customer stickiness, and expand globally beyond the UK market.=20
=20
At the same time, iFast said that iGB risk controls will focus on =
capital,
liquidity and market risks, ensuring deposits are invested within set
mismatch limits for currency, tenor and pricing to achieve required =
returns.
=20
The group expects overall revenues and profitability in H2 FY2025 to =
improve
significantly over those in H1, driven by continued growth in the core
wealth management business, iGB, as well as progress in the ePension
division=92s eMPF onboarding.=20
=20
As at the end of Q2 FY2025, iFast maintained a strong balance sheet with
S$821.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, supported by a healthy =
24.6
per cent return on equity. Directors declared a second interim dividend =
of
S$0.02 per share that went ex-dividend on Aug 6, and they expect =
full-year
dividends of at least S$0.08 per share.

Mak has more than 30 years of experience in the banking industry. He was
appointed executive chairman of Intraco in July 2022, and was previously
independent non-executive chairman from April 2021. His executive role
includes leading the group=92s business and operations.=20
=20
For its H1 FY2025, the group recorded a profit after tax of S$900,000,
compared to S$400,000 in the year before. This was attributed mainly to =
an
income tax credit of S$400,000 that was a reversal of overprovision of
deferred tax liabilities in the prior year.

Intraco trades and distributes plastic resin and liquors, as well as =
offers
trade finance, supply chain solutions, mobile radio infrastructure
management and digital asset advisory. The group said that demand for =
trade
and supply chain finance has risen in Singapore and the region.

Karin Technology holds FY2025 earnings at HK$19.2 million despite lower
revenue
=20
Karin Technology Holdings reported lower sales for its FY2025 but was =
able
to maintain earnings in the same year ended June 30.
=20
Revenue was down 12.4% y-oy to HK$1.93 billion, with softer sales across =
its
three main segments: IT infrastructure, components distribution and =
consumer
electronics products.
=20
However, gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points to 9.2, which
helped hold earnings at HK$19.2 million, up 1% versus the preceding =
FY2024.
=20
The bottom line was supported by higher interest income and lower
administrative costs as well.
=20
Similarly, the company held its total FY2025 dividend steady at 8.78 HK
cents, equivalent to a payout ratio of 98.7%.
=20
As at June 30, cash and equivalents increased slightly to HK$144 million
from HK#127.2 million; gearing ratio improved to 0.14 times from 0.26 =
times.
=20
EO and executive director Michael Ng says that while revenue from the
company's IT segment declined in FY2025, profitability improved due to
higher margins on some deals.
=20
"We will focus on pursuing favourable margins as we strive to offer more
value-added services, particularly in the area of AI solutions," he =
says.
=20
Ng notes that the component distribution segment was hurt by trade =
tensions,
and that Karin remains cautious about this business and will try and =
improve
cost control.
=20
"Meanwhile, in view of the lacklustre retail landscape in Hong Kong, we =
are
closely monitoring the business of our consumer electronics segment," he
adds.
=20
Going foward, Karin Technology observes that while lower interest rates =
have
eased financial costs, recessionary pressures persist and business =
demand
remains subdued.
=20
"Notwithstanding the above challenges, Karin believes its IT segment =
will
drive its future growth as the group expands its strategic focus on AI," =
the
company says, adding that it is "actively" pursuing new distributorships =
to
expand its AI solutions portfolio.
=20
The distribution segment, meanwhile, will face sustained pressure as the
economic landscape remains restrained in mainland China, with =
manufacturing
clients adopting a conservative approach to procurement and forecasting.
=20
"This cautious stance is especially pronounced among exporters, who face
heightened vulnerability to trade disruptions and policy shifts," the
company says.
=20
Last but not least, the consumer electronics segment "may be further
dampened" by reduced foot traffic and spending from tourists, as well as
ongoing store closures in Hong Kong=92s retail scene.
=20
The company will prioritise profitability through disciplined inventory
management, strategic purchasing, and stringent cost controls.

Oxley reduces losses in FY2025; repositions to focus only on property
development
=20
Thanks to higher revenue, lower costs of sales and lower financing =
costs,
Oxley Holdings has reduced its losses for FY2025.
=20
In the year ended June 30, the company was $6.1 million in the red, a =
sharp
drop from $95.9 million of losses incurred in the preceding FY2024.
=20
Revenue for the half year ended June 30 was an increase of 59.8% y-o-y =
to
$198.3 million, which brings its full year revenue to $313.6 million, an
increase of 8.7% over the preceding FY2024.
=20
In FY2025, Oxley Holdings generated net positive cash flows from =
operating
activities of $75.7 million, which includes hotel revenue, rental =
billings,
and overseas projects progress billings.
=20
On the other hand, it has further reduced its debt load by $126.2 =
million.
As at June 30, outstanding bank borrowing and fixed-rate notes totalled
$1.243 billion, out of which $1.155 billion is secured. Having redeemed =
$88
million in unsecured debt after June 30, Oxley has no other unsecured =
debt.
=20
Oxley says that the construction of Oxley Towers Kuala Lumpur City, its
flagship development, is fully completed. It expects to maintain its =
sales
momentum and the first residential units to be handed over as early as
September.
=20
The company expects to collect RM200 million of sales proceeds, followed =
by
a further RM60 million within the next 12 months from its committed sold
units. Another RM32 million will be received in 2027. For now, Oxley =
retains
some RM550 million worth of inventory.
=20
"Encouragingly, transaction volumes have picked up in recent months on =
the
back of the project=92s construction completion," says Oxley, which aims =
to
sell off everything in the next 6 to 12 months.

Renovation works for its KL hotels components are ongoing and the hotels
will be operational "in the near term."
=20
In Singapore, its two hotels managed an average occupancy rate of 86%
combined, while the Shangri-La Hotel in Cambodia achieved 52% since its =
soft
launch. This helped generate hotel revenue of $59.4 million in FY2025 =
versus
$58.2 million in the previous year.
=20
Oxley plans a "strategic repositioning" of its business. Instead of =
engaging
in investment properties and developing hotels, the company now wants to
focus only on property development. With the "right opportunity", it =
will
sell the hotel business.
=20
=93This strategic shift allows us to channel resources into markets and
segments where we have a strong competitive advantage," says executive
chairman and CEO Ching Chiat Kwong.

"By focusing on our core development business and recycling capital from
divestments, we are positioning the group to stay agile, capture growth
opportunities, and create sustainable value for our stakeholders,=94 he =

Singapore-listed parent, Autagco: Superfood Kitchen to liquidate with
closure of last outlet in Raffles City
It has been incurring accumulated losses; negotiations with potential =
buyer
did not go through
=20
[SINGAPORE] Local eatery Superfood Kitchen will enter voluntary =
liquidation
with operations at its last outlet, in Raffles City, ceasing on Sunday =
(Aug
31). =20
=20
Superfood Kitchen faces mounting losses and was not able to agree on =
rental
rates with the landlord, said its Singapore-listed parent, Autagco, in a
Sunday bourse filing.=20
=20
The eatery is the latest in a series of retail operators to shutter in =
the
face of tough business conditions.
=20
=93Since its launch in 2022, Superfood Kitchen has been incurring =
accumulated
losses amid rising operating costs and challenging business environment,
with limited turnaround prospects,=94 said Autagco.=20
=20
Superfood Kitchen had engaged its Raffles City landlord on renewal =
terms,
but could not agree on rental rates, among other matters.=20
=20
Both parties agreed to terminate the lease, with the premises to be =
handed
to the landlord by Sep 11. Autagco expects to incur a one-off S$15,000 =
cost
for the handover.
=20
In the Sunday filing, Autagco noted that it tried to explore =
alternatives to
liquidation. For instance, it entered negotiations with a potential =
buyer
for the Superfood Kitchen master franchise, but did not reach a binding
arrangement.
=20
With the liquidation, Autagco plans to focus on its assisted living =
business
and explore other viable business opportunities, as part of an ongoing
strategic review.
=20
The company has appointed Keith Ng of Reliance 3P Advisory as the =
liquidator
for Superfood Kitchen.=20
=20
Temasek revamp makes sense given the varied capabilities needed to =
manage
growing portfolio=20
Reporting the one-year performance of each of its three portfolio =
segments
could help stakeholders keep abreast of the unfolding evolution
Back in the early 2000s, it puzzled me that Temasek Holdings chose to
describe itself as an Asia investment company headquartered in =
Singapore;
and its key portfolio holdings as Temasek-linked companies instead of
government-linked companies.=20
=20
At the time, more than 90 per cent of Temasek=92s portfolio consisted of =
local
corporate stalwarts such as DBS, Keppel, SIA and Singtel. While these
companies had independent boards and professional managers, they were =
also
important pillars of Singapore=92s economic development.=20
=20
As Temasek expanded over the last two decades, it has indeed become much
more than just a vehicle through which the government holds its local
corporate interests. As at Mar 31, 2025, these Singapore-based Temasek
portfolio companies (TPCs) accounted for only 41 per cent of its net
portfolio value of S$434 billion.
=20
Global direct investments (GDIs) =96 which comprise stakes in far-flung
companies such as Dutch fintech Adyen, Indian hospital operator Manipal
Health Enterprises and Chinese technology giant Tencent =96 accounted =
for a
further 36 per cent.=20
=20
Temasek=92s interests in various partnerships, funds and asset =
management
companies (PFAs) accounted for the remaining 23 per cent of its net
portfolio value.=20
=20
Yet, this expansion has arguably made it even more difficult to put a =
label
on Temasek. Big investment companies are often known for a particular
philosophy or approach, or a focus on certain asset classes.=20
=20
The late John Bogle=92s Vanguard Group is best known for low-cost =
passive
investing. Stephen Schwarzman=92s Blackstone Group is often described as =
an
alternative asset management firm. Warren Buffett=92s Berkshire Hathaway =
has
been an inspiration for long-term, value-oriented stock investors around =
the
world.=20
=20
Temasek=92s approach and focus isn=92t quite as obvious. Managing the =
TPCs, GDIs
and PFAs within its portfolio requires a vast array of strategies and
networks.=20
=20
Last week, Temasek unveiled changes to its organisational structure that
might shine more light on how it operates. With effect from Apr 1, 2026, =
the
three key segments of its portfolio will be managed by separate =
wholly-owned
entities.
=20
Temasek Singapore (TSG) will manage the TPCs; Temasek Global Investments
(TGI) will handle the GDIs; and Temasek Partnership Solutions (TPS) will
oversee the PFAs.=20
=20
The way I see it, if these three divisions also separately report their
performance over one-year periods, and regularly provide updates on how =
they
are executing and evolving their strategies, it could go a long way in
raising the global profile of Temasek and perhaps the Singapore market =
too.
=20
Managing the GDIs, TPCs and FPAs
Temasek provides a fair amount of information about its investment =
approach
and key strategies in its annual reviews.=20
=20
Notably, it has said that its GDIs are aligned to four structural =
trends:
digitisation, sustainable living, future of consumption, and longer
lifespans. =93These trends are interconnected, transcend sectors and
countries, and persist through economic cycles,=94 Temasek said, in its =
most
recent annual review.
=20
Other aspects of its approach disclosed in the recent document included =
how
potential investments are assessed, how it applies its environmental, =
social
and governance framework, and even its attitude to early-stage =
investments.
=20
Last week, Temasek also offered some views on what it takes to =
effectively
manage its GDIs, TPCs and PFAs.
=20
In the case of GDIs, Temasek is generally a minority investor simply =
aiming
to maximise its financial return over a finite period of time. The main
capability required here is a strong investment team to source, evaluate =
and
execute deals.
=20
Managing the TPCs requires more operating capabilities. As the =
controlling
shareholder of these companies, Temasek isn=92t just concerned about =
financial
returns but also whether they are adapting their businesses to a =
changing
world and the emergence of new technologies.=20
=20
With an indefinite holding period, Temasek=92s primary goal with the =
TPCs is
to help them become better companies, with high-calibre boards, strong
management teams, credible business strategies and optimised capital
structures.=20
=20
Meanwhile, the PFAs are an avenue for Temasek to deploy capital for
relatively long periods of time alongside other investors. Being able to
select good managers, and forge strong partnerships that open new =
investment
opportunities are crucial here.
=20
Temasek said last week that its asset management companies =96 which had =
S$90
billion under management as at Mar 31, 2025 =96 are going through a =
strategic
review.=20
=20
Making TPCs more =93pure play=94
Given the varied capabilities Temasek requires to manage its TPCs, GDIs =
and
FPAs, placing them under three separate entities makes a lot of sense, =
in my
view.=20
=20
It could result in each of these portfolio segments receiving more =
focused
attention, and foster a better understanding among Temasek=92s =
stakeholders of
the opportunities and challenges it faces.=20
=20
This is all the more important as Temasek navigates the shifting tide of
global capital driven by trade tariffs, geopolitical tensions and the =
rise
of artificial intelligence. With separate entities managing its TPCs, =
GDIs
and FPAs, Temasek might be better positioned to express how these big =
trends
are affecting the performance of its portfolio.
=20
Having the TPCs managed by a separate entity might also draw the =
attention
of global investors to the long-term potential of these blue chip =
companies
as well as the Singapore market.=20
=20
This column noted in August that the strong performance of TPCs such as =
DBS,
Singtel and ST Engineering contributed significantly to Temasek=92s =
increased
portfolio value during its financial year to Mar 31, 2025 (FY2025); and
helped the Straits Times Index deliver an exceptionally high total =
return of
nearly 30 per cent.
=20
Last week, Temasek offered some views on how it may continue adding =
value to
the TPCs. =93One thing that we are doing is to make sure that our =
companies
are as =91pure play=92 as possible. Conglomerates are out of fashion and =
have
been for some time, but we have to make sure they=92re all =
competitive,=94 said
Temasek=92s chief executive Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara.
=20
He went on to recount how Temasek helped Sembcorp Industries and Keppel =
hive
off their struggling offshore and marine operations =96 which are now =
held
under Seatrium =96 and add billions of dollars to their market value.
=20
=93I=92m not saying we can replicate this with other companies at =
Temasek. There
are still companies, of course, which are competing with each other. But =
if
we put our minds to it, together with the management teams and the =
boards of
those companies, we can create value for shareholders,=94 he added.=20
=20
Report one-year TSRs
In keeping with the strategy of managing its TPCs, GDIs and FPAs via
separate entities, Temasek should perhaps begin reporting the =
performance of
each of these portfolio segments over one-year periods.=20
=20
Temasek said in its most recent annual review that its portfolio =
delivered a
10-year total shareholder return (TSR) of 5 per cent per annum up to Mar =
31
2025, and a 20-year TSR of 7 per cent per annum. =93Our TSR over =
different
time periods is a snapshot of our performance, with the longer time =
periods
being more representative of our performance as a long-term investor,=94 =
it
said.
=20
However, in its annual reviews for FY2004 and FY2005 =96 when most of =
its
portfolio still consisted of TPCs =96 Temasek also provided TSRs for the
preceding one-year, two-year, three-year and five-year periods.=20
=20
As Temasek revamps its organisational structure to manage its =
increasingly
large and sophisticated portfolio more effectively, reporting the TSRs =
for
the three key segments of its portfolio over short periods of time may =
help
its stakeholders keep abreast of its unfolding evolution.

Singapore consultancy Enigmatig opts for US listing where their clients
resonate
The company=92s CEO Desmond Foo says most of its international clients =
are
more familiar with the US
=20
[SINGAPORE] Many Singapore companies that choose to list in the US do so =
in
search of higher valuations and deeper liquidity, but consultancy firm
Enigmatig=92s decision to debut there was mainly driven by consideration =
for
its clients, who are more aware of the American exchanges.=20
=20
Enigmatig =96 which was founded 15 years ago in Singapore and is still
headquartered here =96 began trading on the NYSE American in June, after =
an
initial public offering (IPO) of about three million Class A ordinary =
shares
at US$5 per share that raised some US$15 million.
=20
The company=92s primary business is helping clients incorporate =
companies
overseas and providing related corporate services such as office setup,
licensing and compliance.=20
=20
As at FY2024, it had 55 clients from 15 jurisdictions, with most based =
in
Asia-Pacific markets such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, China and =
the
United Arab Emirates.=20
=20
Enigmatig=92s clients =96 the majority are small businesses, with about =
five to
10 larger ones =96 include many that seek to establish financial =
services
internationally.
=20
Right after the Covid-19 pandemic, Enigmatig moved ahead with its IPO =
plans,
said founder and chief executive officer Desmond Foo in an interview =
with
The Business Times.
=20
He listed three reasons for why the US was picked as the preferred =
listing
location.=20
=20
The first, said Foo, was that clients from different countries felt they
could strongly resonate with the US as Enigmatig=92s choice of listing =
venue.
=20
Enigmatig=92s chief financial officer, Teo Mingwen, said that regardless =
of
where a client is from, the US is acceptable because it is the largest
capital market in the world.
=20
He said that the consultancy=92s international clients were familiar =
with US
bourses such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
=20
By comparison, he pointed out that the global recognition for exchanges =
like
the Australian Securities Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange was =
probably
not as high.
=20
Second, with the experience gained by listing in the US, Enigmatig would =
be
in a better position to provide corporate services to bigger clients =
that
may also want to launch an IPO there in the future, said Foo.=20
=20
The third reason is the opportunity to tap into a large number of
institutional investors and underwriters in the country, he added.
=20
Foo said that access to institutional investors globally =96 also =
offered by a
listing in the US =96 is attractive for Enigmatig=92s clients across =
different
jurisdictions.
=20
In H1 2025, 11 Singapore companies launched an IPO on Nasdaq. In =
contrast,
only two debuted on NYSE American, with one of them being Enigmatig.
=20
The consultancy listed on NYSE American to =93push its own limits=94 and =
take a
road generally less travelled by companies, said Foo.
=20
Enigmatig did not choose to list in Singapore because many of the =
company=92s
international clients may not be that familiar with the Singapore =
Exchange
(SGX), said Teo.=20
=20
Foo noted that most clients are based outside of Singapore, =93so =
whatever we
do in Singapore, they will not be able to see it, they will not be able =
to
feel it=94.=20
=20
He added that if Enigmatig had gone for a Singapore IPO, most of the
institutional investors would have come from Singapore, which is not big =
in
size to begin with.=20
=20
Therefore, =93we can=92t have that much of a chance to actually raise =
funds=94, he
added.=20
=20
On how the SGX could improve to attract more IPOs, Teo noted that many
exchanges elsewhere employ the strategy of getting large-cap listings to
gain attention.=20
=20
This would attract IPOs from smaller companies over time, he said.
=20
From IPO to expansion
For the FY2024 ended Sep 30, Enigmatig=92s total revenue experienced a
year-on-year decline of 13.9 per cent to US$4 million, while gross =
profit
dipped by 15 per cent to US$2.7 million.=20
=20
Its financial performance weakened because two-thirds of its sales team =
were
focused on the IPO and some sales efforts were neglected, said Teo.
=20
=93We are a small company, and manpower constraint is always the biggest
thing,=94 he noted.=20
=20
An unaudited financial report showed that for the first half of FY2025,
Enigmatig=92s total revenue was US$2.9 million, up by 112.1 per cent =
from the
same period in FY2024. Gross profit rose by 192.1 per cent to US$2.2
million.
=20
Teo said that the stronger performance was due to the consultancy =
shifting
its focus back to sales.
=20
Enigmatig will use part of the US$15 million in IPO proceeds to =
strengthen
its business segments.=20
=20
It currently employs about 15 people across four offices in Singapore, =
Hong
Kong, Shanghai and London, as well as a desk in Bangkok.
=20
To enhance corporate services, the consultancy will increase manpower in =
key
markets and establish offices in more places, said Teo.=20
=20
Enigmatig has also built capabilities in regulation technology, =
including a
customer relationship management platform that helps companies reduce
compliance costs.
=20
On this front, it plans to embark on further research and development, =
and
potentially pursue mergers and acquisitions.

iMSCI Futures poised for gains as Singapore equities shine
The SiMSCI Index (MSCI Singapore Free Index) Futures contract is a
derivative instrument based on the SiMSCI Index, which tracks =
performance of
the large- and mid-cap segments of the Singapore market. The index =
consists
of 17 constituents and covers roughly 85 per cent of the free =
float-adjusted
market cap of the Singapore equity universe. As at Jul 31, the top six
constituents include Singapore=92s three local banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB),
Singtel, and international-listed companies such as Sea and Grab.=20
=20
Meanwhile, the SGX MSCI SiMSCI Futures contract remains the most liquid
equity index futures contract on the Singapore market. As at market =
close on
Aug 26, and in SGD terms, the SiMSCI Index gave a total return of 23.35 =
per
cent year-to-date, outperforming the Straits Times Index=92s return of =
16.64
per cent year-to-date.
=20
On Aug 14, the STI hit its all-time high of 4,282.80. From a macro
perspective, we maintain a constructive view on Singapore equities,
supported by compelling valuations, robust sovereign fundamentals, and
favourable policy catalysts.=20
=20
Singapore=92s reciprocal tariff of 10 per cent is the lowest among most =
Asian
peers. At the same time, the country has the only triple-A rated =
sovereign
credit rating in Asia, conferring safe haven status. Valuations appear
compelling on both a relative basis and absolute basis. At 16.6x Last =
Twelve
Months P/E ratio, the SiMSCI trades at an approximate 40 per cent =
discount
to the S&P 500=92s 27.5x and below its own five-year average of 18.0x.
Meanwhile, a 12-month yield of approximately 3.8 per cent looks =
attractive
given falling interest rates.
=20
Investor enthusiasm has been further lifted by MAS=92 planned S$5 =
billion
Equity Market Development Programme, designed to deepen market liquidity =
and
broaden institutional participation - a likely structural tailwind for =
local
equities. Corporates are also leaning towards improving shareholder =
returns
through higher dividends and share buybacks.
=20
Bloomberg data indicates the SiMSCI tilts more towards growth and =
volatility
versus the STI, making it a preferred vehicle for investors seeking
higher-growth and higher-beta exposure among Singapore equities.
=20
In the longer run, we expect the 3M-SORA to continue declining as Fed =
rate
cuts are expected. Key risks include potential volatility in interest =
rates
if the Federal Reserve=92s independence comes under political scrutiny.
Nonetheless, even if such a scenario materialises, Singapore=92s safe =
haven
status should provide relative resilience.
=20
SiMSCI Index Futures technical outlook
=20
The daily chart of the SiMSCI Index Futures Contract shows the contract
having rebounded from its Apr 6  low of 327.50. Using Fibonacci =
extensions
anchored at the August 2024 low, March 2025 high, and April 2025 low, =
our
year-end price target stands near the 123.6 per cent extension at 490.
=20
The contract broke above the 76.4 per cent extension level on Aug 13
following strong earnings from top constituent Sea, whose shares jumped =
by
19.07 per cent in a single session.
=20
Looking ahead, a daily close above 460 would confirm further upside
continuation, while sustained trade below 420 (50-Day Moving Average) =
would
negate the bullish setup. Immediate support lies around the 50-DMA of =
420
while near-term resistance lies around 460, coinciding with the 100 per =
cent
extension level.
=20
Technically, a sustained breakout above 460 (100 per cent Fibonacci
extension) would open the path towards 490, while support holds at the
50-DMA near 420. With the 14-day RSI near 64, conditions are approaching
overbought. Therefore, we see room for near-term consolidation, though =
the
broader trend remains constructive.

WeRide brings latest self-driving vehicle to Singapore, likely for use =
as
Punggol shuttles
=20
SINGAPORE =96 Autonomous driving technology company WeRide has brought =
its
latest five-seater self-driving vehicles into Singapore =96 likely for =
use as
community shuttles that will ply fixed routes within Punggol in a couple =
of
months=92 time.
=20
This is in line with what Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said in
June, that the authorities hope to get the first such self-driving =
shuttles
on the road here by the start of the fourth quarter of 2025.
=20
WeRide, which is headquartered in Guangzhou, confirmed the arrival of =
its
new autonomous vehicles, after one of them was seen being transported on =
the
bed of a tow truck in Jalan Bahar on Aug 28.
=20
Called GXRs, the vehicles are already operating as robotaxis in cities =
like
Beijing and Abu Dhabi. They were developed for mass production with
Geely-owned Chinese commercial vehicle maker Farizon.
=20
The Straits Times understands that WeRide is one of the autonomous =
vehicle
manufacturers that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) has been in talks =
with to
roll out self-driving shuttles in Punggol.
=20
This is in addition to the self-driving eight-seater bus that WeRide =
already
operates in the Resorts World Sentosa integrated resort, which got the =
green
light in July to run without safety personnel on board =96 a first for
South-east Asia.
=20
In response to queries, the Land Transport Authority said more details =
on
the deployment of autonomous shuttles here will be shared later.
=20
Asked about the intended use of the vehicles in Singapore, a WeRide
spokesperson said only that this is part of a partnership that the firm =
has
with a =93leading regional mobility provider=94.
=20
WeRide was one of four autonomous vehicle companies that signed an =
agreement
with ride-hailing giant Grab in March to explore the use of self-driving
technology in South-east Asia.
=20
On Aug 15, Grab announced an undisclosed investment in WeRide as part of =
a
strategic partnership to accelerate the roll-out of robotaxis and
self-driving shuttles in the region.
=20
Neither company would comment specifically about how this investment =
relates
to their plans in Singapore.
=20
ST understands that MOT has also been in talks with another Chinese =
company,
Pony.ai, about supplying vehicles for the upcoming Punggol shuttle =
service.
The Guangzhou-based robotaxi outfit declined comment.
=20
Since March, ComfortDelGro has been working with Pony.ai on a two-year
robotaxi trial in Guangzhou. It has since been reported that Pony.ai is
planning robotaxi trials in Singapore in collaboration with the =
transport
giant.
=20
Public transport operator SMRT, which invested in WeRide in 2022, has =
also
said it is exploring the launch of autonomous shuttle services in one of =
the
housing estates here by early 2026.
=20
This is likely to be Tengah, which is the next location that MOT has in
mind.
=20
Mr Siow had announced plans to roll out self-driving vehicles in Punggol
during a June visit to Guangzhou, where he toured WeRide=92s and =
Pony.ai=92s
facilities and rode on some of their vehicles.
=20
The acting minister said at the time that MOT and potential operators =
were
discussing what type of autonomous vehicles could be brought into =
Singapore
as quickly as possible.
=20
=93We may well be looking at bringing in MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles) =
first,=94
Mr Siow added, noting then that the technology for self-driving cars is =
more
developed than for self-driving buses.
=20
During the same visit, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun =
Xueling
said MOT was considering a couple of initial routes in Punggol for the
autonomous shuttle roll-out.
=20
The MP for Punggol GRC said this was based on feedback from residents, =
who
asked for better connectivity between the western and eastern parts of =
the
town, and more convenient access to amenities such as the polyclinic and =
bus
interchange.
=20
Mr Siow and Ms Sun said in June that the self-driving community shuttles
will be phased in, operating first without any passengers, until =
residents
and road users are comfortable with the vehicles.
=20
Additionally, a safety officer will be on board the vehicle to step in =
when
needed, although this role will eventually be removed and replaced by a
remote operator.

Coastal barriers, shoreline upgrades among proposed moves to shield
southeast Singapore against rising seas
The proposed coastal protection measures will complement the previously
announced Long Island at East Coast to provide a continuous line of =
defence,
said national water agency PUB.
=20
SINGAPORE: To protect the low-lying areas in Changi and the Greater =
Southern
Waterfront from flooding, a study has proposed building coastal =
protection
structures to form a =93continuous line of defence=94, with construction =
set to
begin in the 2030s, national water agency PUB said on Saturday (Aug 30). =

=20
These include three coastal barriers linking Sentosa, Pulau Brani and =
the
mainland, retrofits to the Marina Barrage and raised coastal protection
structures, among other measures.=20
=20
Setback measures, which refer to coastal protection structures built =
further
inland, will also be used at Changi Beach Park so as to preserve beach
access and minimise impact on biodiversity.=20
=20
The coastal protection site-specific study for the City-East Coast =
region
started in 2021 and cost S$18 million (US$14 million). The region =
includes
the Greater Southern Waterfront, East Coast and Changi.=20
=20
PUB, along with relevant government agencies, will next look into =
detailed
studies to develop engineering designs of the recommended measures and
conduct environmental impact assessments, the agency said.=20
=20
Construction of coastal protection measures is slated to begin in the =
2030s.

=20
The recommendations for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi
complement other coastal protection efforts at East Coast, providing a
continuous line of defence to protect the area against rising sea =
levels,
PUB said.=20
=20
This would include the =93Long Island=94 that was announced in 2023, =
which would
create an enclosed waterbody in front of East Coast Park and would also
serve as a barricade against erosion in the mainland.
=20
Speaking at the launch of the Coastal Protection Exhibition on Saturday =
at
VivoCity, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan =
Kim
Yong said that unlike larger countries, Singapore does not have the =
option
of "retreating" inland.=20

"Protecting our coastlines is therefore of existential importance," said =

protection is another such endeavour that will require sustained efforts
over generations =96 and just as with our public housing, water and
infrastructure, it is a necessary investment in the safety, security and
resilience of our nation."
=20
The need for coastal protection
At this year=92s Budget, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that an
additional S$5 billion will be injected into the Coastal and Flood
Protection Fund. The fund was announced in 2020 with an initial fund of =
S$5
billion to protect Singapore against rising sea levels.=20
=20
As a low-lying country, about a third of Singapore=92s land is less than =
five
metres above mean sea level.=20
=20
Studies from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore and the third
National Climate Change Study projected that Singapore could see a =
permanent
mean sea level rise of up to 1.15 metres by 2100.
=20
This means that low-lying areas of the country will be vulnerable to the
effects of permanent mean sea level rise, tides and storm surges.
=20
If no action is taken, widespread flooding could happen in the City-East
Coast region during extreme coastal storm surges in 2050.
=20
PROTECTING THE GREATER SOUTHERN WATERFRONT
The Greater Southern Waterfront region is set to become a mixed-use
waterfront precinct with leisure and tourism developments, said Mr Gan.
=20
The area stretches from Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal to Marina East, and
includes Sentosa and Pulau Brani, which will be developed into a tourism
destination as part of the Greater Sentosa Master Plan.
=20
From the study, three coastal barriers and shoreline measures are
recommended.=20
=20
Two coastal barriers will link eastern Sentosa to Pulau Brani and then =
to
mainland Singapore, based on a map provided by PUB. The third barrier =
will
connect western Sentosa to mainland Singapore, although the exact =
location
has yet to be determined.
=20
These coastal barriers comprise a series of gates that remain open by
default to minimise environmental impact and allow maritime activities =
to
take place. During high tides and storm surges, the gates will close to
protect the area against coastal flooding.=20
=20
Similar barriers can be found in other countries, such as the Thames =
Barrier
in the United Kingdom and the Maeslant Barrier in the Netherlands.
=20
PUB had considered the alternative approach of raising seawalls, or =
vertical
barriers built of concrete and rocks, and constructing tidal gates along =
the
waterfront promenade.=20
=20
A tidal gate is typically placed across a water channel, such as a canal =
or
a large outlet drain. It consists of barriers that can be lifted or =
lowered
to control the flow of water.=20
=20
However, such an approach would block sea views and would require more =
land,
PUB said.=20
=20
As part of its study, the agency had considered feedback from =
stakeholders,
including experts, nature groups and youth about preserving direct =
access to
the sea and waterfront promenade.
=20
Mr Gan said the construction of coastal barriers will allow the public =
to
still have access to the coastline and enjoy the sea view, which was
highlighted by several participants during these feedback sessions.=20
=20
Meanwhile, existing coastal protection along Pasir Panjang Ferry =
Terminal to
Labrador Nature Park, and from Marina South to Marina East will be =
upgraded,
PUB said.
=20
This includes raising existing sloped protective structures built along
shorelines, known as revetments, at Marina South.
=20
The Marina Barrage will also be retrofitted to guard against rising sea
levels.=20
=20
A MIX OF MEASURES IN CHANGI
=20
As for Changi=92s coastline, PUB said the study recommended a mix of
revetments, tidal gates and bunds as protection measures. A bund is a =
raised
coastal defence structure made from compacted soil, clay or sand.=20
=20
The Changi region encompasses Changi Village, Changi Beach Park, Changi
Airport, Changi Naval Base and other industrial and aviation facilities. =

=20
Changi Beach Park could see raised bunds, which can double up as =
footpaths
or cycling tracks.=20
=20
To preserve recreational access to Changi Beach Park, these bunds will =
be
positioned further inland.=20
=20
Doing so will not only maintain beach access, it will also serve to =
minimise
impact to existing intertidal habitats, PUB said.
=20
Additionally, there are plans to install tidal gates at locations where
existing major canals discharge to the sea. PUB said that the location =
and
design of such gates will need to be further studied so they integrate =
with
the landscape.=20
=20
PUB will also carry out measures at the shoreline. At Changi South, =
existing
revetments and seawalls may be raised, with the potential of =
incorporating
design features to add recreational value to the area, PUB said.=20
=20
Ms Hazel Khoo, director of the Coastal Protection Department at PUB, =
said
that Singapore's coastal protection requires "innovative solutions" that =
go
beyond traditional approaches.=20
=20
"Coastal protection requires long-term and careful planning, and =
trade-offs
are inevitable. There are still coastlines with unique characteristics =
that
we will need to conduct site-specific studies progressively," she said,
adding that PUB will explore solutions that balance diverse priorities.=20
=20
Site-specific studies at other regions of Singapore=92s coastline are =
ongoing
or will commence soon, PUB said. They include site-specific studies at
Sentosa Island and the southwestern coast, which are slated to commence =
in
2026.=20
=20
The Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and PUB will also =
introduce a
Coastal Protection Bill next year, to enforce compliance with coastal
protection standards and spell out the responsibilities of stakeholders
involved.=20
=20
PUB will also launch a code of practice for coastal protection by the =
first
half of 2026 to set standards for the design, construction and operation =
of
coastal protection structures in Singapore.=20

DPM Gan makes 5-day working visit to China, to attend commemorative =
events
for WWII
He will visit Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing from Aug 31 to Sep 4
=20
[SINGAPORE] Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong is making a five-day =
working
visit to China from Sunday (Aug 31), during which he will meet with his
counterparts and attend events marking the 80th anniversary of the end =
of
World War II (WWII).
=20
This will be his first visit to China since becoming deputy prime =
minister.
He will visit Guangzhou, Shenzhen and the capital Beijing from Aug 31 to =
Sep
4, the Prime Minister=92s Office (PMO) said in a statement.
=20
His trip comes about two months after Prime Minister Lawrence Wong made =
an
official visit to Beijing and Tianjin at the invitation of Chinese =
Premier
Li Qiang.
=20
DPM Gan, who is also minister for trade and industry, is expected to =
meet a
range of counterparts to =93discuss new avenues to strengthen the =
bilateral
partnership and exchange views on regional and international =
developments=94,
PMO said.
=20
His visit coincides with a series of commemorative bilateral milestones =
this
year, including the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations, and the 15th anniversary of the China-Singapore Guangzhou
Knowledge City (CSGKC).
=20
In Guangzhou, he will meet with Governor of Guangdong Wang Weizhong and
visit the CSGKC, where he will engage Singapore companies based there.
=20
The township spans 232 square kilometres and hosts more than 50 =
Singapore
companies, many of which are eyeing expansion in Guangdong and the =
Greater
Bay Area.
=20
In Shenzhen, he will meet with the Chinese Communist Party=92s Secretary =
of
the Shenzhen Municipal Committee Meng Fanli; visit Chinese companies; =
and
meet overseas Singaporeans at an evening reception.
=20
On Sep 3, at China=92s invitation, DPM Gan will attend commemorative =
events
marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII.
=20
=93China will redouble its efforts, as it=92s already doing, to develop =

The following day, he is expected to meet Vice-President Han Zheng,
Vice-Premier He Lifeng, and his counterpart, Minister of Commerce Wang
Wentao.
=20
DPM Gan will be accompanied by Senior Minister of State for Trade and
Industry Low Yen Ling, as well as officials from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Ministry of Trade and Industry.
=20
His last visits to China were in 2023: one trip with then-prime minister =
Lee

Transforming Singapore=92s state properties into great spaces
The Singapore Land Authority manages some 11,000 hectares of state land =
and
2,600 state buildings, and is looking at ways to optimise and rejuvenate
some of these heritage buildings
=20
[SINGAPORE] The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) manages a wide range of =
state
properties. Its mission lies in optimising land resources for the =
nation=92s
economic and social development. Is the SLA different from a private
property landlord? How does the SLA transform properties into great =
spaces?
BT senior correspondent Leslie Yee spoke to Carrie Wong, director of
business planning and development, SLA in his PropertyBT podcast. We
reproduce excerpts from the podcast here.=20
=20
Carrie Wong: Singapore is a very small city-state where land is a very
strategic resource for the country. We, the SLA, are the custodian of =
state
land and buildings. We manage approximately 11,000 hectares of state =
land
and 2,600 state buildings. We are very much guided by our own vision:
limited land, unlimited spaces.
=20
We are also looking at ways to optimise and rejuvenate some of these
heritage buildings. When there=92s no immediate development plans for =
them, we
will, as much as possible, put them out for what we call interim use.
Through adaptive reuse in the interim, we hope to create value for our
people, make use of all these state properties and connect the =
community.
=20
Leslie Yee: Many of us live in high-rise HDB or condo blocks. I think it =
may
be fun to live in an old house =96 like the residential properties that =
SLA
manages =96 which was built before Singapore was independent. Escape the
hustle and bustle of modern urban Singapore by living in an enclave of =
all
landed homes with one=92s own garden. Sounds rather enticing. Who helps =
manage
and market SLA=92s residential properties?
=20
CW: These are the heritage houses, as well as walk-up apartments (such =
as
those) in Monk=92s Hill. Built in the colonial days, they... come with =
very
rich, rustic charm. They are managed by agents appointed by SLA. The =
agents
look after the general leasing matters, such as renewal of tenancies,
marketing vacant units, and operational matters like maintenance of =
common
areas, and so forth.
=20
LY: Is maintaining such colonial era black-and-white homes costly? =
What=92s
the thinking behind keeping such homes instead of freeing up land =
occupied
by these homes for more intensive use?
=20
CW: Heritage houses are important to Singapore=92s culture and heritage, =
so
much so that it is important to preserve some of them. It is also a
Singapore story to tell.=20
=20
Recently, we pivoted one or two of these black-and-white houses along =
Orange
Grove Road and Goodwood Hill to low-key office use. We talked to a lot =
of
businesses, and we realised there is demand =96 for a family office, for
example.=20
=20
We also looked at how we can cluster these heritage houses into a gated
community for co-living. Admiralty at Sembawang is one example that SLA
launched to encourage multi-generation co-living concepts.
=20
The tender for the master tenancy of 44 buildings at 2 Moulmein Road =
closed
in August with 13 bids.
Historic Moulmein Road site draws 13 bidders for master tenancy of =
cluster,
with bids for monthly rent of up to S$388,800
LY: How important is the amount of rent that these properties generate?
After all, the state will seek to generate good financial returns from =
its
properties. For properties that are let out for commercial uses, do you
focus mainly on the rental collected? What considerations are there?
=20
CW: We are the statutory board. We go beyond just talking about =
maximising
rental and revenue collection. We also consider how these state =
properties
can be activated to promote social good and bring value to the =
community. We
are moving away from just calling a price tender where highest bidders =
will
win the tender. We call a price and quality tender, where we can place a
quality component at a higher weightage.
=20
Very importantly, we encourage a placemaking component in our price and
quality tenders. We will look at how the tenderers will draw footfall,
inject vibrancy into the state property. It=92s always nice to see a =
very
nicely renovated heritage building, but you need the soul.
=20
I share an example =96 New Bahru. It=92s the old Nan Chiau school, which =
has now
successfully been transformed into a lifestyle destination. A space =
housing
almost 40 local homegrown brands, ranging from F&B (food and beverage) =
to
art and craft. It is very encouraging that we enable and transform a =
space
to bring people together, to bring youngsters together.
=20
LY: New Bahru is very much a go-to place. What is your take (on the F&B
scene)? Are high rentals in Singapore suffocating the F&B industry? And =
can
SLA do more to help create a thriving F&B scene here for locals as well =
as
visitors?
=20
CW: When we let out our state property by the price and quality tender, =
we
look at not just the price component, but really the quality, the
placemaking. For example, Kada, the Kadayanallur Street property, which =
was
a former St Andrew=92s missionary hospital. =20
=20
There are a lot of new F&B startups that sprouted in Kada. I see a few =
cafes
run by very young entrepreneurs. We thought the state property really
presented a good opportunity to help them pilot some of the concepts in =
a
little pocket of space within the master tenant operator model.
=20
LY: Obviously you=92re a very responsible landlord. Do you think that =
some of
the private property landlords should learn from you and not be so =
fixated
on just rent alone?
=20
CW: As government, we do our best. We are not looking out just for
ourselves, but for the people of Singapore. We want to also make sure =
that
these spaces are provided to meet community needs.
=20
LY: Managing properties calls for creativity. A building might be just a
rectangular concrete block. A well-managed building can come alive. What =
is
the secret?=20
=20
CW: At SLA, we proactively and extensively engage the public, the =
businesses
and different kinds of stakeholders to really understand what is the =
current
trend. For example, co-living is a very new kind of trend. So we said, =
let=92s
try. We identified a few suitable state properties, for example, =
shophouses
along Hindu Road. (It was) pretty successful. =20
=20
One thing led to another. We heard from stakeholders that there are
independent seniors looking for more diverse accommodation choices =
outside
their homes. Ah, let=92s try a multi-generation co-living concept. We =
had 98
Henderson Road which is an old school building, the former Henderson
Primary. Today, you go there, you can see young foreign students playing
pickleball together with the =93ah mas=94, the grannies.
=20
We want to see things like that... enabling state property spaces,
(building) community and having very positive impact.
=20
LY: I=92m curious, why would older Singaporeans go and live there when =
many
Singaporeans obviously own their own homes?=20
=20
CW: Interestingly, there is a group of seniors who really want to try =
out
new things. Our tenant operator partnered with a senior programme =
provider
St Bernadette Home to bring these seniors for a retreat to experience =
the
silver co-living lifestyle. This kind of partnership and collaboration =
is
also helping businesses to come together.=20
=20
LY: Perhaps you can share a little bit on what has been done to support
social enterprises and the arts. Are these spaces financially viable?
=20
CW: We try to pivot some properties in a timely manner to meet social =
needs
like halfway houses, nursing homes. There=92s also, for example, the =
social
impact hub, a building housing different non-profit organisations and
charities together to co-create solutions =96 the Temasek ShopHouse. =
Then we
have the former election office building at Prinsep Link, now being
transformed into the Foundry, which houses 20-over charity startups. I =
think
this is a very good ecosystem, and we hope to encourage more.=20
=20
LY: Do all these space users feel that they=92ve got enough security of =
tenure
over their properties? Or do they sometimes have this fear that... once =
the
lease expires, (they) have to go and find new premises. What=92s your
thinking?=20
=20
CW: These state property spaces are by and large put up for what we call
interim use. Every old building, be it an old school or army camps, is
seated on a piece of land that eventually might be still slated for
long-term development that has to meet the more long-term national =
needs.=20
=20
All these properties are being let out on a nine-year tenure. We =
understand
there is a need for certainty for businesses, so we have also progressed
from a typical tenancy structure of three + three + three years, to five =
+
four years. The first five-year tenure gives the business operator some
certainty to plan better.=20

Techno-utopia rises in Malaysia=92s US$100 billion Forest City debacle
The construction of Network School will employ a =91portable template=92 =
that
can easily be replicated across the world, says serial tech investor =
Balaji
Srinivasan
=20
IN A hotel-turned-campus on a reclaimed island in Malaysia, crypto and =
tech
entrepreneurs are building software, chomping down Australian prime =
ribeye,
hitting the gym =96 and getting schooled in a radical blueprint for =
creating
new sovereign states from scratch.=20
=20
They have descended on Forest City to attend Network School, the =
brainchild
of former Coinbase executive and The Network State author Balaji =
Srinivasan.

=20
In this troubled megaproject once envisaged to house some 50 times its
current population, they are conducting a real-life experiment of sorts =
with
Srinivasan=92s vision of =93startup societies=94 defined less by =
historical
territory than shared beliefs in technology, cryptocurrency and light
regulation.=20
=20
Techno-utopian ideas have circulated in Silicon Valley and the crypto
community for well over a decade, with few signs of gaining wider
acceptance.=20
=20
Srinivasan=92s bet
Yet Srinivasan is doubling down on his bet that the world is ripe for =
his
brand of nation-state disruption, and is making Forest City a testing =
ground
for plans to roll out the movement globally.
=20
=93Just like at age 18 you choose your college, at age 18 you=92ll =
choose your
country,=94 Srinivasan said on Thursday (Aug 28) in a keynote speech at =
the
Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong. =93And it=92s already starting =
with the
startup societies.=94=20
=20
Recent events have provided some tailwind for the quixotic effort. The
election of Donald Trump, and the crypto-friendly policies he=92s =
pursued,
have rapidly pushed the asset class into the financial mainstream.=20
=20
More broadly, Trump=92s win was also seen as a repudiation of the =
=93woke=94
ideology and regulatory overreach Srinivasan has long criticised. While =
it
isn=92t clear exactly why Srinivasan picked Forest City for his school, =
the
location offers some distinct advantages, not least low rents and easy
access to Singapore and its international airport.=20
=20
Officials seeking to stave off political fallout from what=92s been =
widely
derided as a white elephant have taken a raft of measures to increase =
its

dangled
a zero per cent tax rate for family offices =96 investment vehicles for =
the

Nearly 400 students, many of them entrepreneurs, have so far made the
journey to Forest City to study everything from coding to unconventional

testing
whether a shared ideology =96 rather than just shared territory =96 can =
bind a

food, for those who opt for a shared room.=20
=20
Blending the practical and the ideological
Network School=92s curriculum blends the practical and the ideological.
Mornings are spent in product sprints and coding sessions; afternoons in
seminars exploring topics from the Meiji Restoration to Singapore=92s
statecraft and the mechanics of decentralised governance.=20
=20
Guest lectures double as both technological deep-dives and ideological
sermons, according to half a dozen students interviewed by Bloomberg.
=20
The campus also mirrors Silicon Valley=92s infatuation with longevity =
and
health, right down to a commercial-grade gym and specially designed =
workout
routines. Students follow a protein-heavy diet inspired by longevity =
guru
Bryan Johnson=92s =93Don=92t Die=94 movement. The menu of the restaurant =
at the
Marina Hotel, a kind of social nexus for the school, is heavy on protein
shakes and steak.=20

=93We=92re all getting jacked,=94 said Prad Nukala, a student at the =
school and
founder of crypto startup Sonr, which describes itself as a =
=93blockchain for
decentralised identity.=94
=20
After co-founding DNA testing startup Counsyl in 2008 and serving as its
chief technology officer, Srinivasan spent five years at venture capital
firm Andreessen Horowitz, first as general partner and then as board

He joined Coinbase as CTO in 2018 when the crypto exchange bought a
portfolio company he oversaw and left after a little over a year, =
according
to his LinkedIn profile.=20

In a 2013 speech at Y Combinator=92s Startup School, Srinivasan brought =
his
ideas about what he saw as a fundamental conflict between some modern =
nation
states and innovation to a wider audience.=20
=20
In the address, he advocated for Silicon Valley=92s =93ultimate exit=94 =
from the
US, which he argued was obsolete and hostile to innovators. In essence: =
If
the society you live in is broken, why not just =93opt out=94 and create =
a new
one?
=20
The Network State: How To Start a New Country, published in 2022, =
expanded
on Srinivasan=92s =93exit=94 concept to outline how online, =
ideologically aligned
communities can use crypto and digital tools to form new, decentralized
states.=20
=20
A network state can be geographically dispersed and bound together by =
the
Internet and blockchains, he says, and the aim is to gain diplomatic
recognition.
=20
Srinivasan, a prolific public speaker, podcast guest and poster on X, =
has
taken aim at what he calls the =93Blue Tribe, shorthand for the US =
liberal,
Democratic-aligned political class.=20
=20
On the Moment of Zen podcast in September 2023, he outlined how the =
=93Grey
Tribe=94 =96 entrepreneurs, innovators and thinkers =96 can retake =
control of San
Francisco from the Blues using a variety of tactics, like allying with =
local
police.=20
=20
The effort would involve gaining control of territory, according to
Srinivasan, who didn=92t advocate violence. =93Elections are just the =
cherry on
the cake,=94 he said. =93Elections are just a reflection of your total =
control
of the streets.=94
=20
Srinivasan, who has also criticised Trump policies, didn=92t respond to
requests for comment.
=20
With Network School, Srinivasan directed his pitch squarely at the
like-minded. =93The more respect you have for legacy institutions, and =
the
more respect they have for you, the less suitable you=92ll be as an
applicant,=94 Srinivasan wrote in an August 2024 blog post announcing =
the
first enrolment. =20
=20
To Jack Schneider, director of the Center for Education Policy at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst, educational projects backed by tech
elites can smack of hubris. =93I don=92t doubt that there=92s a sincere =
charitable
impulse for lots of these folks,=94 Schneider said.
=20
 =93But then there=92s another impulse, which is to believe not only =
that you
are a visionary in terms of your ability to redesign systems and =
structures,
but that you also have a unique insight into human nature and the way =
that
people should be leading their lives.=94
=20
Alyse Sue, co-founder of a decentralised-science project called =
Transhuman
Coin, joined the first Network School cohort last year after what she
described as a spur-of-the-moment application. =93I wrote, =91I=92m a =
girl =96 does
that give me extra brownie points?=92,=94 she recalled.
=20
When Network School launched, Sue reorganised her life to join. Some =
other
attendees quit their jobs or relocated their startups to Forest City, =
she
said.=20
=20
For Sue, the school was a natural fit. A decade earlier, she had helped
start a =93transhumanist meetup=94 in a Sydney pub that happened to be =
one of
the first in the city to accept Bitcoin.=20
=20
That small community evolved into a project aimed at funding longevity
research and biotech experiments, from brain-computer interface studies =
at
the University of Technology Sydney to collaborations with early-stage =
labs
on cancer and ageing.=20
=20
Willy Ogorzaly came to Forest City mainly to accelerate his crypto =
startup
and secure some funding, although he was also drawn to Srinivasan=92s
teachings.=20
=20
Practical knowledge
While he said the curriculum =93definitely aligns with my values=94, the =
biggest
benefit was the practical knowledge gained from a range of workshops =96 =
and
the opportunity to work on his business surrounded by like-minded =
people.=20
=20
=93All day, you=92re surrounded by other awesome builders,=94 the =
33-year-old
said. His project, Nounspace, won third prize and collected US$20,000 in =
a
pitch competition (which wasn=92t run by Network School) that took place =
while
he was there.
=20
Ideas similar to Srinivasan=92s have long percolated on the fringes of
political thinking, embodied in part in efforts such as the Seasteading
initiative initially backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, which seeks to =

In 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin conducted his own

Indonesia=92s gas crunch strains domestic industries, may shake trust in
exports
South-east Asia=92s largest economy diverts gas exports to domestic =
industries
as supply crunch hits manufacturers
=20
[JAKARTA] Indonesia=92s growing gas shortage is forcing the government =
to
prioritise domestic industries =96 a decision which analysts said could
undermine its credibility as an exporter and push long-standing partners
such as Singapore to look elsewhere.=20
=20
The supply crunch will also have a =93severe impact=94 on Indonesia=92s
gas-reliant manufacturers =96 from those in fertilisers and =
petrochemicals to
ceramics and steel =96 as they face operational strain, threatening a =
fallout
in investments and jobs.
=20
Already, the tight conditions have led the authorities to ask overseas =
gas
customers to accept shipment delays and to urge exporters to defer =
cargoes
well into 2026, a decision which holds significant implications for
importers.
=20
Pang Lu Ming, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, said that while sellers =
and
buyers cannot reallocate volumes on short notice, frequent reallocations
could prompt Singapore to seek alternative gas sources.
=20
=93It would likely require a multi-month or even year-long process, with
makeup volumes supplied from elsewhere. If such reallocations are not
specified in the contract, both Indonesia and Singapore are bound to =
honour
the original terms, meaning the committed molecules must continue to =
flow,=94
he said.
=20
=93But if Indonesia does continue to prioritise domestic demand over =
exports,
it would push Singapore to seek other gas and energy sources.=94
=20
Responding to queries from The Business Times, the Energy Market =
Authority
(EMA) said Singapore=92s natural gas supply remains stable.
=20
=93EMA will continue to closely monitor developments and work with =
industry
partners to ensure Singapore=92s energy security and price stability,=94 =
it
added.
=20
To safeguard against potential disruptions, Singapore sources natural =
gas
from a diverse range of suppliers, including liquefied natural gas (LNG)
from around the world and piped natural gas from Malaysia.
=20
Indonesia has been a pillar of South-east Asia=92s gas trade, supplying
Singapore through pipelines and shipping LNG cargoes to buyers across =
Asia
and beyond for decades.=20
=20
Now, with the gas crunch on, Indonesian factories and other industrial =
users
are demanding more fuel just as production is slowing, making it a =
challenge
for the country to both satisfy local needs and honour export =
commitments.=20
=20
BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said that despite growth prospects for
Indonesia LNG production, exports are unlikely to rise significantly in =
the
near term as the government prioritises domestic consumption.
=20
In the first half of this year, Indonesia=92s total gas consumption hit =
5,598
billion British thermal units (BTU) per day, with nearly 70 per cent
consumed domestically, and the remainder exported, underscoring the =
ongoing
balancing act between meeting local demand and overseas commitments.
=20
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources projects Indonesia=92s =
natural
gas demand to exceed 6,000 billion BTU per day between 2025 and 2030, =
driven
by rising industrial consumption and the government=92s energy-mix =
programme.
=20
Swap deal
A multiparty gas swap was launched by SKK Migas, Indonesia=92s upstream
regulator, on Aug 22 to ease immediate domestic shortages while =
maintaining
existing export contracts.
=20
The arrangement redirects 27 billion BTU a day from the West Natuna =
Supply
Group, which includes Medco E&P Natuna, Premier Oil Natuna Sea and Star
Energy (Kakap), to state-owned gas distributor Perusahaan Gas Negara =
(PGN)
for domestic delivery.
=20
Physical volumes are transported through pipelines operated by Medco E&P
Grissik and PetroChina International Jabung in South Sumatra, which =
channel
natural gas from Indonesia to Singapore. The deal involves key upstream
contractors and buyers, including state-owned Pertamina and overseas =
buyers
such as Singapore=92s Sembcorp Gas.
=20
In March, Sembcorp announced that it had terminated the gas sales =
agreement
its unit had signed to import piped natural gas from Indonesia=92s Mako =
gas
fields, citing regulatory hurdles.=20
=20
BT reached out to Sembcorp for comment on how the swap could affect gas
prices in Singapore, but received no response.
=20
Pang from Rystad Energy said swaps occur only under long-term =
agreements,
where the characteristics of the gas molecules are clearly defined.
=20
=93This is usually possible in regions with well-integrated pipeline
networks.=94
=20
Natural gas powers more than 92 per cent of Singapore=92s electricity, =
sourced
mainly through pipelines from Malaysia and Indonesia. The rest is =
imported
as LNG.
=20
Gas crisis hit industries
Under President Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia is racing to boost
industrialisation and achieve 8 per cent growth, but the recent gas =
crisis
shows that the country is caught between a rock and a hard place, =
balancing
rising domestic demand with declining output.
=20
In an information disclosure report released on Aug 15, PGN said gas
distribution from upstream oil and gas contractors fell in August,
temporarily disrupting deliveries to several customers in West Java and
parts of Sumatra.=20
=20
PGN attributed the disruption to an unplanned shutdown at existing gas
suppliers and delays in finalising additional supplies, which affected =
both
required volumes and distribution stability in the affected areas.=20
=20
Manufacturers then raised the alarm.=20
=20
Seven manufacturing sub-sectors currently benefit from the =
government=92s
subsidised gas price programme, locally known as HGBT: fertiliser,
petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, ceramics, glassware and rubber =
gloves.
But recent cuts in allocations have led to operational strain.=20
=20
Indonesian media reported that two tableware factories in Tangerang =
halted
production and laid off around 700 workers earlier this month, citing =
gas
supply restrictions.
=20
The Ministry of Industry confirmed the pressure on manufacturers, with
spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief warning that the shortage is =
hitting
economic activity across sectors. =93This crisis is having a severe =
impact on
the manufacturing industry,=94 he said in a statement.=20
=20
=93It affects not only manufacturers, but also investment sentiment,
production processes and job creation.=94
=20
Industry groups warned that the situation could worsen. Indonesia=92s =
Olefin,
Aromatic and Plastic Industry Association has criticised the =
government=92s
handling of the crisis, saying prolonged shortages could trigger mass
layoffs.
=20
Jakarta-based fatty acid manufacturer Sumi Asih reported that since Aug =
13,
it has been receiving less than half of its contracted gas volumes, =
which
were initially capped at 48 per cent of the agreed quota and gradually
lifted to around 70 per cent. This has left the company struggling to =
meet
commitments to buyers in China and Europe.
=20
In response to queries from BT, PGN said the situation has been =
resolved,
with industrial customers under the HGBT programme now receiving =
supplies
based on the government=92s reallocation scheme.
=20
Temporary relief
However, industry experts cautioned that the respite may be short-lived
without deeper structural reforms.
=20
Prateek Pandey, senior vice-president at Rystad Energy, said the swap =
could
help secure additional volumes for the domestic market in the near term,
likely through the end of this year and into next.=20
=20
=93But over the longer horizon, Indonesia will need to either secure new
long-term import contracts or accelerate the development of its =
substantial
domestic resources,=94 he said.
=20
Indonesia=92s LNG exports fell gradually from 17 million tonnes per =
annum
(mtpa) in 2015 to 10 mtpa in 2023, largely due to declining output from =
the
Tangguh and Bontang LNG plants and the government=92s decision to =
prioritise
domestic consumption.
=20
Production in South Sumatra, home to key blocks such as Pertamina EP, =
the
Corridor Block and Jambi Merang, has been steadily falling for five =
years.
=20
Few new supply projects have come online to offset the declines, forcing
regulators to redirect existing supplies to fertiliser plants, power
stations and industrial users. New demand is also emerging, most notably
from a power plant in Batam.
=20
Upcoming projects such as the Abadi LNG project, Indonesia Deepwater
Development and exploration in the Andaman Sea could theoretically meet =
both
domestic and export demand, but delays remain a major risk.
=20
=93Indonesia has enough potential to meet domestic demand while =
continuing
exports,=94 Pandey said. =93The real risk is delays in development, =
which could
affect investor sentiment.=94
=20
Indonesia is not alone in facing gas supply challenges. Malaysia may
redirect more Sarawak output to domestic use, while Australia has long
struggled to balance exports with local demand.
=20
Pandey said the broader lesson is that governments should focus on =
expanding
supply rather than merely curbing exports.=20
=20
=93Developing pipeline resources already in the works and improving
connectivity is critical,=94 he said. =93Many pipelines require both =
investment
and investor attention.=94

Protests there were sparked by outrage over lawmakers=92 housing =

nearly 10 times the monthly minimum wage in Jakarta, and fuelled by tax

lower-income Indonesians. On Sunday, Prabowo announced that parliament =

For Wee Khoon Chong, a senior strategist with BNY in Hong Kong, the baht =

[MELBOURNE] Australia=92s A$4.3 trillion (S$2.8 trillion) retirement =
system,
long regarded as one of the world=92s best-regulated savings pools, is
emerging as a new frontier for crypto.
=20
Coinbase Global and OKX, two of the largest digital-asset exchanges, are
rolling out products aimed at steering pension money into =
cryptocurrencies,
underscoring how digital assets are edging further into mainstream =
finance.
=20
The initial focus is self-managed superannuation funds, or SMSFs, which
already make up about a quarter of Australia=92s pension pool. Unlike
mainstream pensions, which have largely avoided crypto, these DIY funds =
give
individuals wide latitude over their investments.
=20
=93It does make sense that we are probably seeing a bit more interest in
crypto in the self-managed super fund space first,=94 said Fabian =
Bussoletti,
technical manager at the SMSF Association. =93Perhaps the larger funds =
will
catch up over time.=94
=20
Coinbase is nearing the launch of a dedicated SMSF service, with more =
than
500 investors on its waiting list, according to John O=92Loghlen, the
company=92s Asia-Pacific managing director. OKX launched a similar =
product in
June, and demand has exceeded expectations, said Kate Cooper, chief
executive of its Australian arm.
=20
Crypto holdings in SMSFs remain modest: about A$1.7 billion as at March, =
tax
office data show. But that=92s a seven-fold increase since 2021. Both
exchanges are betting the trickle will accelerate, forcing regulators =
and
institutional funds to confront an exposure they have so far resisted. =
For
now, AMP is the only major pension provider to disclose an investment in =
the
asset class.=20
=20
OKX=92s product and Coinbase=92s planned offering will also help =
investors
establish SMSFs by referring them to third-party providers such as
accountants and law firms. While there=92s no minimum balance required,
ongoing administrative costs, including mandatory independent audits, =
mean
SMSFs are typically only cost-effective for larger accounts.
=20
=93This product will be more for buy-and-hold investors rather than =
active
traders,=94 said O=92Loghlen.
=20
Coinbase, which flagged plans to target SMSFs last year, expects to roll =
out
its service in the coming months. A poll of those on its waiting list =
showed
80 per cent intend to establish a new SMSF, with 77 per cent planning to
invest up to A$100,000 in digital assets, according to Coinbase.
=20
The demand is generationally split, says O=92Loghlen. Baby Boomers, =
often
nudged by children eager for exposure, are adding crypto to existing
accounts. Younger investors, meanwhile, are opening SMSFs years earlier =
than
past practice and skewing them heavily towards digital assets.
=20
Bitcoin has surged almost 20 per cent this year, hitting a record last =
month
as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order easing US =

only
if they can overcome entrenched regulatory scepticism.

[TIANJIN] Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi was =
committed
to improving ties with China in a key meeting with President Xi Jinping =

Sunday (Aug 31), as both leaders discussed the need to expand trade and
investment ties against the backdrop of US tariffs.
=20
Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day
meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, along with Russian
President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from Central, South and
South-east Asia and the Middle East, in a show of Global South =
solidarity.

The bilateral meeting took place five days after Washington imposed
punishing 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods due to New Delhi=92s =
purchases
of Russian oil. Analysts say Xi and Modi are looking to present a united
front against Western pressure.
=20
Modi said India and China pursued strategic autonomy, and their ties =
should
not be seen through the lens of a third country, according to an Indian
foreign ministry readout of the meeting.

Modi and Xi discussed the need to proceed from a =93political and =

multilateral platforms, the Indian statement said.
=20
=93We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual =
respect,
trust and sensitivities,=94 Modi told Xi during the meeting on the =

Border issue
Modi said an atmosphere of =93peace and stability=94 has been created on =
their
disputed Himalayan border, the site of a prolonged military stand-off =
after
deadly troop clashes in 2020, which froze most areas of cooperation =
between
the nuclear-armed strategic rivals.
=20
He added that an agreement had been reached between both nations =
regarding
border management, without giving details. The neighbours share a 3,800 =
km
border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.
=20
=93We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India
relationship,=94 Chinese state media Xinhua reported Xi as saying.

China-India ties could be =93stable and far-reaching=94 if both sides =
focused on
viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added.
=20
Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after =

accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed
tariff threats from Washington.

BYD=92s 30% profit plunge may be worrying sign of things to come
BEIJING - The fallout is becoming impossible to ignore in the fierce =
battle
among Chinese carmakers.
=20
With BYD reporting a staggering 30 per cent plunge in quarterly profit =
on
Aug 29, its first decline in over three years, it=92s become clear that =
not
even dominant players are safe in the cutthroat battle for market share.
=20
Despite robust overseas sales, BYD=92s net income of 6.36 billion yuan =
(S$1.14
billion) for the three months though June 30 fell short of analysts=92
estimates for a modest increase.
=20
Heavy discounting saw BYD=92s gross margin contract to 18 per cent from =
18.8
per cent in the first half of 2024, although that figure is still among =
the
top in the industry, exceeding rivals such as Zhejiang Geely Holding =
Group
and Chery Automobile.
=20
BYD blamed =93industry malpractices=94 and =93excessive marketing=94 for =
pressuring
its bottom line =96 an ironic twist considering BYD has been a major =
driver of
the price war, leading multiple rounds of cuts since 2023, including its
latest in May. Its most recent discounting campaign prompted the =
government
to warn automakers off =93rat-race competition,=94 saying that price =
wars can
affect supply-chain security and seriously damage the international
reputation of =93Made-in-China.=94
=20
BYD=92s stumble comes as a shock given its global expansion has gained =
pace in
2025, with the brand making major inroads in markets like Brazil, which
accounts for about one-third of its international sales, Australia,
Singapore and parts of Europe. Overseas revenue, excluding Hong Kong, =
Macau
and Taiwan, was up 50 per cent in the first six months versus the same
period a year ago to 135.4 billion yuan.=20
=20
Calling the margin shrinkage =93scars of competition,=94 a note =
published by
research firm Stanford C. Bernstein over the weekend observed that =
margin
pressure persisted despite the higher overseas sales mix. =93Increased
promotional efforts didn=92t achieve anticipated volume growth,=94 =
analysts
including Eunice Lee wrote, adding higher capital expenditure further
weighed on margins. Bernstein maintained its outperform rating but =
lowered
its target price from HK$133 to HK$130. Shares in BYD closed in Hong =
Kong on
Aug 29 at HK$114.40, ahead of the earnings release.
=20
Outside of gross margins weakening, the company=92s net profit =
attributable to
shareholders increased at a slower rate, another sign profitability is =
under
pressure, while borrowings jumped to 39.1 billion yuan from 28.6 billion
yuan as of the end of last year.
=20
Research and development expenses are also rising quickly, up more than =
50
per cent year-on-year, showing the company is leaning heavily into
innovation even though margins are tightening. BYD is likely =
deliberately
ramping up spending on core technologies =96 batteries, electrification =
and
intelligence =96 as part of its long-term strategy to secure its lead in
new-energy vehicles. Arguably, there are fatter margins to be had from
premium models like the Yangwang or Fangchengbao.
=20
The company=92s latest financial statements indicate BYD is paying =
suppliers
more quickly than before. =93The turnover days of the trade payables and =
bills
payables of the group were at a low level in the automotive industry and
further declined during the reporting period as compared to the same =
period
in 2024,=94 the Aug. 29 filing said, without revealing the exact number =
of
days.
=20
Back in 2023, BYD was taking an average of 275 days to pay suppliers, a
period far exceeding global industry norms, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.
=20
The company said in June it would comply with new government rules to =
pay
suppliers within 60 days, a big adjustment that would likely hit its =
working
capital outflows, reducing any flexibility in a downturn.
=20
It may also cause adjustments to other parts of its balance sheet down =
the
line =96 a report by accounting consultancy GMT Research said that =
without
supply chain financing, BYD=92s true net debt would be closer to 323 =
billion
yuan, compared to the 27.7 billion yuan officially on its books as of =
the
end of June 2024.
=20
Nevertheless, the automaking powerhouse isn=92t yet under any serious
financial strain and a slower pace of growth may well be more =
sustainable as
the company transitions from industry-disrupting upstart to global =
giant.
=20
BYD seems to be increasingly turning its attention outside of China, =
noting
that higher profitability there has made its overseas business a key =
driver
for continued growth. =93The group has been proactively advancing the =
planning
and construction of additional overseas production capacity to fully =
prepare
for a surge in international demand,=94 its interim report said.
=20
BYD is =93well on track to hit one million units in overseas volumes, =
ahead of
guidance at 800,000,=94 Bernstein=92s Ms Lee said, adding that annual =

China=92s home sales slump extends as prices continue to decline
BEIJING - China=92s home sales extended their slump in August even as =

=20
The value of new home sales from the 100 largest property companies =

year
earlier, and followed a 24 per cent slump in July. Sales have fallen for =
six
straight months.
=20
China=92s housing slump has dragged on for more than four years, with =
sales
falling further since the second quarter. The worsening decline in home
prices also signals that the effects of a stimulus blitz a year ago are
wearing off, stoking concerns about deflation. =20

Calls for further policy support for the residential market have grown.
China=92s capital city of Beijing and financial hub of Shanghai both =

Additional measures could come as early as September, with authorities
preparing to speed up urban renovation projects, the Securities Daily
reported this month, citing an industry expert.

Even if the market picks up in the short term, China=92s longer-term =
housing
outlook remains grim. Demand for new homes in cities is expected to stay =
at
75 per cent below its 2017 peak in the coming years, due in part to a

The benchmark CSI 300 Index has been on a tear, rising 10% in August to =

be a major rotation into stocks and equity funds.
=20
China=92s household deposits fell 0.7% from a record high in June to =
160.9
trillion yuan (US$23 trillion) in July, suggesting investors are putting

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists pointed to excess household savings

=20
Darwin Mao, a 28-year-old tech employee in Beijing, has been eying a =
shift
to the stock market since last September.
=20
Back then, a stimulus blitz by China=92s central bank sent stocks =
zooming
higher, bringing an end to a years-long selloff fueled by fears about =
the
economy. The CSI 300 jumped around 25% in a week, leading to a feeding
frenzy among local investors. It wasn=92t until this August that the =
index
beat the highs set back then.
=20
=93Stocks rallied so fast that I didn=92t have time to get in,=94 said =
Mao, adding
that this time he was keen not to miss out. =93I took the opportunity to
invest some of my spare money at the end of July and I=92ve been =
increasing my
holdings. I believe the rally will extend until the end of this year.=94
=20
The CSI 300 has risen in nine of the past 10 weeks, taking its gain from
this year=92s low in early April to 25%. Investors have expressed =
confidence
that authorities will keep sentiment supported before a Sept. 3 military
parade, which is set to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World =
War
II. China has a history of propping up its stock market ahead of major
political events to project an image of stability.
=20
Some strategists, including those at Morgan Stanley, have flagged signs =
the
market is overheating, with some technical indicators flashing =
overbought
signals. In one example, shares of Cambricon Technologies Corp more than
doubled in August, prompting the AI chip designer to warn investors that =
its
stock price may no longer reflect fundamentals. That sent the stock =
tumbling
on Friday.
=20
So far, the shift from savings to stocks is a trickle: The roughly 2.1
trillion yuan jump in non-financial deposits =97 a proxy for liquidity =
in
stocks, funds and trust accounts =97 in July was just the highest since
February, and not much above the seasonal average over the past decade.

Turnover Jumps as Cash-Rich Investors Buy Stocks
=20
A key question is how well Chinese officials can manage market swings.
Regulators and local investors have been scarred by previous periods of =
boom
and bust, most dramatically a bubble a decade ago that wiped out more =
than
US$2 trillion of market value when it burst.
=20
Local broker Sinolink Securities Co has hiked margin requirements for =
stock
traders, while some onshore mutual funds have limited the size of new
orders. It is unclear whether these moves were triggered by regulatory
guidance, but it=92s common for Chinese officials to issue =
behind-the-scenes
instructions to brokers and funds during periods of wild stock swings.
=20
Chinese media has also cautioned investors against speculation.
=20
Local investors clearly have plenty of cash to put to work, but fund
managers and analysts say it will be steady rises rather than wild =
swings
that will encourage them to stick around this time.
=20
=93It=92s important this time to have a slow bull market,=94 said Wu =

The NBS composite PMI of manufacturing and non-manufacturing was 50.5 in

=93The macro outlook in the rest of the year largely depends on how long
exports can stay strong and whether fiscal policy will become more

the world=92s top consumer market =96 a push that some producers have =

Earlier in August, the US and China extended their tariff truce for =

Profits at China=92s industrial firms fell for a third straight month in =
July,
official data showed last Wednesday, highlighting how businesses are =

struggling with subdued demand and persistent factory-gate deflation at

=20
Policymakers have ramped up consumer subsidies, but a prolonged property
slump is still crimping spending, with real estate a key store of =
household
wealth.
=20
Households=92 reluctance to take out mortgages was reflected in July =
bank
lending data, which unexpectedly contracted for the first time in 20 =
years.
=20
And consumer spending could take a further hit if a recent ruling by =
China=92s
top court banning firms and employees from skirting social insurance
payments leads to job losses, with many companies and workers already
struggling to make ends meet. Urban unemployment edged up to 5.2 per =

The decision should support cash-strapped local authorities =96 deprived =

Tokyo bourse pressed for more disclosure on management buyouts
The concerns underscore how low valuations are still overhanging the =
market,
even after Japan=92s key equity indexes stormed to fresh record highs in
August
=20
[TOKYO] The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) remains under pressure to do more =
to
protect minority shareholders during management buyouts (MBOs), just =
weeks
after requiring more disclosures on such deals.
=20
Pacific Industrial, a supplier for Toyota Motor, and car-care products =
maker
Soft99 are among companies that have announced plans to go private in
management buyouts, since new rules came into effect on Jul 22.
=20
The bourse requires companies exiting the market through MBOs or
acquisitions by controlling shareholders to provide explanations =
regarding
procedures and price fairness, with the intention of protecting =
investors
from losses due to delistings at excessively low prices. Yet some deals =
are
still being viewed as unfair to investors.
=20
The new disclosures alone are not enough to reassure shareholders, said =
Sho
Tsuzuki, an attorney at Atsumi & Sakai in Tokyo who deals with financial
regulations. =93As long as firms follow specified procedures, they can =
claim
fairness,=94 he said.
=20
The book value of companies has been one area of focus for investors =
amid
the TSE=92s years-long campaign to unlock higher returns to =
shareholders. The
concerns underscore how low valuations are still overhanging the market,
even after Japan=92s key equity indexes stormed to fresh record highs in
August.
=20
The number of MBOs has hit 20 this year as at Aug 25, on pace to exceed =
the
record of 21 reached in the 2011 calendar year, according to M&A data
provider Recof Data.
=20
The TSE will follow up after the rule revision and continue to consider
necessary measures, an exchange spokesperson said.
=20
=93Many investors will not be satisfied with tender offers that value
companies below one times book value,=94 which may indicate a low offer =
price,
said Eiji Yamada, executive principal at business consultancy Japan =
Research
Institute.
=20
The price-book ratio (PBR) has been getting attention amid the recent
corporate reforms led by TSE, and now shareholders want firms to realise
high valuations in MBOs as well, he said.
The first MBO announced after the rule revision was by Pacific =
Industrial.
The price-book ratio based on the tender price was 0.7, even though the
company had set a target PBR of 1.0 in its integrated report, said =
Satoru
Matsuhashi, chief executive officer of Nanahoshi Management. He =
questioned
whether the takeover price, set at a premium of about 40 per cent, was
appropriate.
=20
An official in Pacific Industrial=92s accounting department said that =
should
the company be liquidated, its book value would be significantly =
impaired
due to factors including factory demolition costs, which makes a PBR of =
less
than one reasonable.
=20
The tender offer for Koatsu Kogyo, which is being held till Sep 18, is =
also
causing a stir. The tender price represents a premium of 11 per cent =
over
the then prevailing market price, with a price-book ratio of around 0.4. =
The
construction company said on Aug 19 that an individual investor had
requested an extraordinary shareholders=92 meeting to demand a price =
increase.
=20
The price is appropriate and the business environment will remain
challenging, Sei Moriyama, an employee in Koatsu=92s administrative
department, said.
=20
Soft99 last month also announced an MBO to seek more flexible =
management.
Some investors are concerned because the price is slightly below a
price-book ratio of one.  Soft99 did not respond to an email with =
questions,
and no one was available to comment when reached by phone.
=20
Generally speaking, it can be difficult to require companies to disclose
everything because that may include confidential business information,
according to Tetsuya Ishida, an attorney at Ushijima & Partners =
specialising
in corporate governance.
=20
It=92s also not realistic to expect all delistings to have a price-book =
ratio
above one, said Nao Makino, a partner at Kaname Capital. As long as
companies have looked for potential buyers, =93the price ultimately =
depends on
whoever is willing to pay=94, he noted.
=20
Still, the rules mean there=92s room for companies to do MBOs or other =
deals
that are not fair for general shareholders, and that =93could reduce the
appeal of Japan=92s stock market=94, said Koji Nakatsuka, chief =

Mitsubishi Heavy to double gas turbine capacity as demand soars
Natural gas is seen as a stable alternative to wind and solar power, one
that=92s also cleaner than burning coal, and more readily available than
nuclear energy
=20
[TOKYO] Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aims to double its gas turbine =
capacity
in the next two years as demand for the equipment rises globally due to
replacement and data centre needs.
=20
The Japanese manufacturer is seeing orders multiply due in part to =
turbines
installed decades ago nearing the end of life, chief executive officer
Eisaku Ito said on Friday (Aug 29).
=20
=93We were working towards boosting production capacity by 30 per cent, =
but
that=92s not enough to meet growing demand,=94 Ito said. =93Fulfilling =
those
orders is our top priority.=94
=20
The decision comes at a time when demand for gas turbines has increased
globally, due to the proliferation of data centres, new manufacturing =
and
continued electrification. Natural gas is seen as a stable alternative =
to
wind and solar power, one that=92s also cleaner than burning coal, and =
more
readily available than nuclear energy. Other manufacturers, such as GE
Vernova, are also seeing an increase in orders for turbines.
=20
Mitsubishi Heavy is working to expand output by improving the efficiency =
of
its production chain, he said, even as the cost of making turbines has
nearly doubled in the past few years due to expensive materials, =
supplies
and staffing.
=20
Boom and bust cycles in turbine demand make long-term investments a =
risky
bet, with varying forecasts on the speed and size of future demand from =
data
centres. Mitsubishi Heavy=92s spending will remain judicious, Ito said. =
=93The
goal is to be as lean as possible,=94 even though demand should remain =
strong
over the next decade, he added.
=20
Mitsubishi Heavy, which manufacturers everything from forklifts to heavy
payload rockets, is one of the biggest turbine makers in the world. Ito =
took
over as the head of the firm earlier in April.
=20
Earlier this month, Mitsubishi Heavy was selected as a preferred bidder =
to
build a fleet of warships for Australia, the first of its kind for the

Japanese nail salon attempts reinvention as major Bitcoin holder
=20
Convano Inc was, until recently, a sleepy Tokyo-listed operator of nail
salons. Now it wants to become one of the world=92s largest corporate =
holders
of Bitcoin =97 the latest in a wave of radical financial reinventions =
pulling
the likes of biotech firms and regional banks into crypto=92s orbit.
=20
Even as signs mount that the digital-asset treasury boom is losing =
steam,
Convano has unveiled a highly ambitious plan: raise about =A5434 billion =
(US$3
billion) and acquire 21,000 Bitcoin =97 equivalent to 0.1% of the total
supply. At the time of announcement, its market value was a fraction of =
that
sum. Its shares have since more than doubled.
=20
As of Aug 25, however, it has raised just 2% of the required funds and =
holds
a modest 365 Bitcoin. To make good on its gambit, Convano is following a
model popularized by Michael Saylor=92s Strategy: generate retail and
institutional interest, lift the share price, then convert that momentum
into capital for further Bitcoin purchases.
=20
=93We will enhance corporate value with the new plan which will increase =
our
stock price 10 times,=94 said Motokiyo Azuma, a director at Convano who =
heads
the firm=92s finance and crypto strategies.
=20
In the =91build it and they will come=92 world of crypto, projecting big
ambitions is part of the business model. Bold targets =97 even those far
beyond a company=92s current means =97 serve a function: they set =
expectations,
attract attention, and, in the best-case scenario, move the market just
enough to make the math work.
=20
The company is also presenting the pivot as a rational response to
macroeconomic pressures. A prolonged slide in the yen =97 around 21% =
weaker
against the dollar over the past decade =97 has pushed up the cost of =
wages
and raw materials for its consumer services business.
=20
=93We started to think about Bitcoin because of the persistent yen
depreciation and geopolitical risks,=94 Azuma said. =93Bitcoin is a =
long-term
store of value.=94
=20
Of the money Convano has raised to date, =A54.5 billion has come from
corporate bonds. It wants to acquire Bitcoin in three phases, assuming =
an
average price of =A519.9 million per coin. Nomura Securities and SMBC =
Nikko
Securities are acting as brokers. The company has not disclosed any =
anchor
investor or timeline for completing the fundraising.
=20
Japan has emerged as a surprising centre for the eye-catching business =
of
Bitcoin accumulation via listed vehicles. Metaplanet Inc, a former hotel
operator, now has nearly 19,000 Bitcoin, placing it among the top 10 =
holders
globally.
=20
The risk is that the momentum behind crypto treasuries unravels. =
So-called
PIPE and SPAC deals have been used to turn a slew of low-growth =
companies
into crypto proxies. So far, the results have been mixed. Peter =
Thiel-backed
Ethzilla lost more than half of its value within days of pivoting to a =
Ether
accumulator.

Even the giants of crypto stockpiling, such as Saylor=92s Strategy, are =

investor confidence. If the stock price plunges, the financing model
buckles.
=20
=93It=92s like catching a falling knife,=94 said Esme Pau, head of =
capital markets
at blockchain security group Certik. =93The same volatility that =
inflates
valuations can erase them just as quickly.=94
=20
Azuma says the shift is a response to economic pressure. Japan=92s =
onerous
crypto taxation rules could make listed proxies like Convano a popular =
way
of getting exposure to digital assets in the country.
=20
But the strategy rests on high hopes. Convano aims to buy 21,000 Bitcoin
without the cash flow to fund it. Its success hinges on how long markets =
are
willing to price in the crypto-reinvention story =97 and whether they =
still
see economic value in the treasury model over competing Bitcoin vaults, =
such
as exchange-traded funds.
=20
=93The funding scale =97 which is multiple times its value =97 makes the =
plan,
solely via equity-based funding from share-price rise, highly =
ambitious,=94
said Convano=92s Azuma.

The kidults are more than all right for toy companies
There is more than just escapism at work as grown-up collectors and
hobbyists swell the market
THESE days you don=92t have to look far to spot an AFOL. For the =
uninitiated,
these are individuals who call themselves Adult Fans of Lego =96 a =
growing
customer segment for the Danish toy company that is increasingly chasing
this so-called =93kidult=94 market.=20
=20
From Star Wars figurines to Jellycat plush toys and Labubu monster =
dolls,
adults are hoovering up toys at a rate that has forced the whole =
industry to
rethink its customer base.=20
=20
Hasbro now courts grown-up collectors, Mattel has launched an adult =
=93brick
shop=94 to build elaborate Hot Wheels cars and =93throwback =
collections=94 of
American Girl dolls from the 1980s and 90s. Lego has a =93botanicals=94 =
range
that allows customers to make bonsai trees and flowers from its bricks =
=96 for
display as well as play. =20
=20
This market is no longer a sideshow, nor catering to niche interests of
anoraks. In Europe and the US, adults who buy toys for themselves are
increasingly among the most reliable customers, willing to pay premium
prices and shopping more frequently than parents buying for under-12s. =
US
sales to over-18s increased by 18 per cent in the first half of 2025,
indicated data firm Circana. And in the year to Jun 30, this cohort
accounted for 19 per cent of the total US toy industry sales. And recent
growth was nearly split between men and women.
=20
 Escape amid the overwhelm
Retail analysts point to a mix of nostalgia and the positive feelings
associated with play, particularly at a time of political instability,
economic anxiety and news avoidance. Who can blame them? Toys and games
offer a pocket of calm and an escape amid the overwhelm.
=20
An employee at a Lego store in London, where a queue of what appeared to =
be
mainly over-18s was snaking around the corner, said adult customers
increasingly bought sets to =93relax=94 and =93divert their minds from =
their
everyday lives=94.=20
=20
For others it=92s about the chase =96 particularly for collectibles =96 =
and the
feeling of accomplishment. =93Some of these are hard to get =96 and very
expensive,=94 one reseller told me. His customers range from doctors and
finance bros to construction workers. The common thread: =93It=92s about =
a sense
of achievement =96 getting something rare, something others want.=94
=20
For many, that thrill of ownership can be a substitute for bigger life
milestones. When owning a home or starting a family can feel out of =
reach,
completing a toy collection is relatively achievable.=20
=20
Some products are chased for profit as much as pleasure and demand can
change. Funkos =96 the bobble-headed character toys =96 may not be as =
popular
any more; Pokemon cards are again a hot commodity. =93It=92s an =
addiction for
some, like gambling,=94 the reseller said, describing clients who scour =
online
Discord community chat groups to track the next big thing. His business =
can
undoubtedly be lucrative. =93I sold a specific figurine for more than
US$10,000,=94 he added.
=20
Large companies are feeding the chase with monthly =93drops=94 of =
limited
editions. For them, the adult market is as much about =
=93displayability=94 as
anything else, where toys act as conversation starters or interior =
design
pieces.
=20
But the trend also taps into a broader shift: adults reclaiming =
attention
and tactile engagement. In the same way that hobbies such as embroidery, =
DIY
or even padel have surged, building the Titanic out of Lego offers a =
respite
from screens and a way to channel focus.
=20
It=92s no wonder then that Games Workshop Group =96 the creators of =
tabletop
battle game Warhammer =96 has seen its share price rise 3,000 per cent =
since
the start of 2016. Aficionados paint miniature soldiers and fight =
others=92
=93armies=94 at in-person tournaments. The growth has even propelled a =
Warhammer
economy =96 from strategy coaches to expert painters.=20
=20
The pandemic =96 which spurred sales of puzzles and board games as =
people were
locked down at home =96 acted as a catalyst and reignited lost hobbies =
and
childhood memories. =93I never had the skill or money to do it well =
(when I
was younger),=94 said a friend in the investment world who now 3D prints =
and
paints his own soldiers. He has dedicated an entire room in his home to =
his
interest.=20
=20
For buyers, toys have in some ways become tools for adult coping =96 =
objects
that promise to delight, give a sense of control and even represent =
small
wins in a world where all three seem short in supply. Sellers are only =
happy
to help. Riding the wave of recent obsessions, Pokemon-themed Lego sets =
are
set to hit shops for the first time next year.=20

Meta to add new AI safeguards after Reuters report raises teen safety
concerns
=20
META is adding new teenager safeguards to its artificial intelligence =
(AI)
products by training systems to avoid flirty conversations and =
discussions
of self-harm or suicide with minors, and by temporarily limiting their
access to certain AI characters.
=20
A Reuters exclusive report earlier in August revealed how Meta allowed
provocative chatbot behavior, including letting bots engage in
=93conversations that are romantic or sensual.=94
=20
Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in an email on Friday (Aug 29) that =
the
company is taking these temporary steps while developing longer-term
measures to ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate AI experiences.
=20
Stone said the safeguards are already being rolled out and will be =
adjusted
over time as the company refines its systems.
=20
Meta=92s AI policies came under intense scrutiny and backlash after the
Reuters report.
=20
US Senator Josh Hawley launched a probe into the Facebook parent=92s AI
policies earlier this month, demanding documents on rules that allowed =
its
chatbots to interact inappropriately with minors.
=20
Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed alarm over the
rules outlined in an internal Meta document which was first reviewed by
Reuters.
=20
Meta had confirmed the document=92s authenticity, but said that after
receiving questions earlier this month from Reuters, the company removed
portions that stated it was permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage =
in
romantic role play with children.
=20
=93The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and =
inconsistent
with our policies, and have been removed,=94 Stone said earlier this =
month.

Meta's AI leaders discuss using Google, OpenAI models in apps, The
Information says
=20
META Platforms is considering partnerships with rivals Google or OpenAI =
to
enhance artificial intelligence (AI) features in its applications, The
Information reported on Friday (Aug 29), citing people familiar with the
conversations.
=20
Leaders at Meta=92s new AI organisation, Meta Superintelligence Labs, =
have
explored integrating Google=92s Gemini model to deliver conversational,
text-based responses for queries submitted to Meta AI, the company=92s =
primary
chatbot, the report said.
=20
Discussions have included leveraging OpenAI=92s models to power Meta AI =
and
other AI features in Meta=92s social media apps, the Information added. =
Any
deals with external model providers such as Google or OpenAI are likely
temporary steps to enhance Meta=92s AI products until its own models =
advance,
the report said. A priority for the lab is ensuring its next-generation
model, Llama 5, can compete with rivals, it added.
=20
Inside Meta, the company has already integrated external AI models into =
some
internal tools for staff, The Information reported. For instance, =
employees
can use Anthropic models to code via the company=92s internal coding
assistant, the report added, citing three people familiar with the =
matter.
=20
=93We are taking an all-of-the-above approach to building the best AI
products; and that includes building world-leading models ourselves,
partnering with companies, as well as open sourcing technology,=94 a =
Meta
spokesperson said in a statement. OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, which =
backs
OpenAI, did not immediately respond to Reuters=92 requests for comment.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
=20
Earlier this year, Meta committed billions of dollars to bring on former
Scale AI chief executive officer Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat
Friedman to co-lead Meta Superintelligence Labs, while offering generous
compensation packages to attract dozens of leading AI researchers to the
initiative. REUTERS

SoftBank, Rakuten tap Japan=92s booming retail demand for bonds
=20
SALES of corporate bonds to Japan=92s mom and pop investors are booming, =
on
track to surpass last year=92s record as bigger returns draw buyers =
looking to
protect their savings from inflation.
=20
Well-known names such as railway operator Keio and supermarket giant =
Aeon
are among those tapping the retail bond market, with the latter selling =
its
debut retail bond on Friday (Aug 29).=20
=20
The offerings are tempting non-professional investors with rates as high =
as
3.34 per cent on five-year notes from SoftBank Group, a prominent =
technology
and telecoms holding company. That=92s almost triple the yield on =
government
bonds of the same maturity.
=20
Sales have reached about 1.5 trillion yen (S$13.1 billion) in the first =
five
months of the fiscal year started Apr 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That=92s after companies in Japan sold a record 2.4 trillion =
yen of
bonds to individuals last fiscal year, the data show.
=20
Expectations that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates again this =
year
as inflation takes hold =96 a marked shift from years of sub-zero policy =
=96 has
increased the focus on higher returns.
=20
While the country=92s major stock indexes are trading around record =
highs,
offering enticing returns, the volatility in equities this year has
highlighted the attractiveness of regular income payments on bonds.
=20
=93Bonds offer interest income and return the principal as long as =
there=92s no
default, so they=92re more attractive than just leaving money in the =
bank,=94
said Koji Ota, a 37-year-old worker in the transportation industry in =
Osaka,
who=92s been investing in corporate debt for the past three years.
=20
A person who bought one million yen of the two-year retail notes sold by
e-commerce giant Rakuten Group in February 2023 with a coupon of 3.3 per
cent would have received about 1.07 yen million in total, including both
regular interest payments and the principal at maturity. In contrast,
two-year time deposits at Mizuho Bank offer an interest rate of 0.325 =
per
cent, and comparable government notes yield about 0.87 per cent.
=20
Safer than stocks
While the Topix index of stocks has rallied about 30 per cent since the
start of last year, the gains were punctuated by sharp sell-offs of =
around
20 per cent in August last year and this April.
=20
=93Jumping into stocks felt too risky,=94 said Kyoko Takahata, a =
37-year-old
housewife in Okayama in western Japan, who last year moved a fifth of =
her
savings into bonds sold by three Japanese firms as rising interest rates =
led
her to reassess finances. She chose corporate bonds because they offer
higher yields than government debt and provide predictable income.=20
=20
Some of the issuers looking to get a bigger slice of Japan=92s 2,200 =
trillion
yen of household assets offered themed bonds, or non-monetary =
incentives, to
leverage their name recognition. The =93Rakuten Cardman Bond=94 featured =
a
superhero-like character, and a deal from Fukui Prefecture =96 where
prehistoric sauropod and theropod skeletons have been found =96 offered =
a
lottery for dinosaur-themed goods.
=20
With its first retail bond in 31 years, rail and leisure group Keio ran =
a
lottery for prizes including a stay at the luxury Keio Plaza Hotel in =
Tokyo,
dinner at high-end teppanyaki restaurant Ukai-tei and FC Tokyo football
gear.
=20
=93We see this as a way to build stronger ties with retail investors,=94 =
said
Yuki Iimuro, who handles fundraising at Keio=92s treasury department.
=20
Yet the freebies linked to many deals may detract buyers from seeking an
understanding of the risks involved in the investments.=20
=20
The broader corporate bond market in Japan for retail and institutional
investors alike isn=92t without its flaws. The Japan Securities Dealers
Association sent questionnaires to nine major local and foreign =
brokerages
asking about bond selling irregularities, such as overstating to issuers =
how
much demand there is for their debt, according to people familiar with =
the
matter.=20
=20
=93As rates climb, retail investors are paying more attention to =
yields,=94 said
Toshiyasu Ohashi, a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Chiba
University of Commerce and a veteran of Japan=92s credit market. =93Yet =
higher
yields usually mean higher risk. We need to raise financial literacy and
rethink how these bonds are structured, marketed and regulated to =
protect
individuals.=94
=20
Deals keep coming to the market, though. Aeon priced 60 billion yen of =
notes
on Aug 29 with a coupon of 2.025 per cent.
=20
Takatoshi Kabayama, who oversees debt issuance at Aeon=92s finance =
department,
said the expansion of tax-free investment accounts has led to growing
investor appetite. =93With benchmark interest rates having risen, we =
judged
that this bond can attract investors even without offering promotional
perks,=94 he said. BLOOMBERG

AI billionaire Lucy Guo pushes into crowded social media field
=20
LUCY Guo got into the artificial intelligence industry early, =
co-founding
software provider Scale AI nine years ago. It made her a billionaire by =
the
time she was 30.
=20
Now the Carnegie Mellon University dropout is building another business,
Passes, a platform where celebrities like Olivia Dunne and Bella Thorne =
can
help turn fame into fortune by connecting directly with their fans. But =
this
time, Guo is running into well-established competitors and legal =
challenges
in a business where success is far from certain.
=20
Backed by US$50 million in funding since its December 2022 launch, =
Passes is
vying in a field that=92s already crowded. Patreon is known for working =
with
podcasters, while Cameo, a former highflier, focuses on celebrities and
OnlyFans is big in porn.
=20
Passes is between those poles. It=92s used mainly by influencers already
popular on TikTok and Instagram, and the content tends to be edgy. Guo =
says
its strength is service.
=20
=93We just want to be like a superfan club for creators,=94 Guo, =
Passes=92 chief
executive officer, said in an interview. Her aim is to provide =
influencers
=93the entire infrastructure to be a business=94.
=20
Passes=92 headquarters in West Hollywood, California, scream Tinseltown.
Beyond the pink neon sign in the centre of the office, there=92s a bar =
fit for
a nightclub and a floor-to-ceiling water feature.
=20
Guo=92s aim is to capture the vibe of social media=92s biggest stars =96 =
the
Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat influencers who make money by advertising
products, in between sharing videos of their daily lives =96 and to have =
the
facilities they need for their work.
=20
Passes=92 founder grew up building social apps and starting companies. =
Raised
in Fremont, California, she started coding early, creating arcade games =
and
virtual pet websites before studying computer science and human-computer
interaction in college.
=20
She dropped out after landing a Thiel Fellowship in 2014, obtaining =
funding
to develop a food delivery app. She also did stints at Facebook, =
Snapchat
and the knowledge-sharing site Quora.
=20
At 22, Guo joined with Quora associate Alexandr Wang to co-found Scale =
AI.
The company, which labels the data that AI companies use to train their
chatbots, recently sold a 49 per cent stake to Meta Platforms for =
US$14.3
billion. The co-founders had a falling out, Bloomberg reported earlier. =
Guo
left in 2018, but her share made her a billionaire.
=20
The next Patreon
As Guo was searching for her next project, she started hearing from
influencer friends who were struggling to make a living from one-off
endorsement brand deals. Many were turning to subscription platforms =
like
Patreon, which offer regular, monthly payouts.
=20
=93You could do a brand deal and you might not get paid out for like six
months,=94 Guo said. =93Brand deals are super inconsistent.=94
=20
Guo texted a few investors, telling them she wanted to create the next
version of Patreon. Within 24 hours, she had raised a few million =
dollars.
=20
The company, like Patreon, helps creators make money by charging fans =
for
access to exclusive content, such as video chats, one-on-one calls and
direct messages. Creators typically keep about 90 per cent of the money. =
As
at February 2024, Guo said, Passes had paid out tens of millions of =
dollars
to about 1,000 creators.
=20
Alyssa McKay, a lifestyle influencer with over 10 million followers on
TikTok, uses Passes to connect directly with her fans and share =
exclusive
content, such as a tour of her new house.=20
=20
=93It allows me to create a unique and specialised experience with my
audience,=94 McKay said. =93I was so surprised and moved with how many =
people
subscribed just to see the first look of me being a first-time =
homeowner.=94
=20
Guo attributes the app=92s popularity to its technology, such as using =
AI to
test which photos or videos will get fans to pay, and its hands-on =
approach.
The office doubles as a sort of =93Soho House for creators=94, she said, =
with a
podcast studio, photo room and, soon, a recording studio. Passes=92 50
employees help influencers shoot videos or design merchandise.
=20
=93If you walk into Forever 21 you=92re not getting the same treatment =
as you do
when you walk into like Hermes,=94 Guo said. =93And like, we give that
Hermes-level service to our creators.=94
=20
That high-end focus carries over to Guo=92s personal life. She=92s =
thrown
parties at Coachella, been spotted with celebrities such as Billie =
Eilish
and Charli XCX, and in 2023 staged a Passes-hosted birthday party for
herself dubbed =93Lucypalooza=94.
=20
Based in Miami at the time, Passes that year raised US$9 million from a
group of investors led by Multicoin Capital and acquired Fanhouse, an
Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup that helps creators monetise their
audiences. The acquisition added employees and creators who were using =
the
platform. Passes had only about 40 creators at the time.
=20
Today, Passes remains far behind Patreon, which has over 100 million
memberships, and OnlyFans, which boasts nearly 380 million fan accounts. =
To
keep growing, Guo began guaranteeing creators=92 incomes if they =
switched from
other platforms, offering some as much as US$500,000, according to a =
person
familiar with the agreements.
=20
=93There=92s a lot of competitors in this arena,=94 said Andrew Graham, =
head of
business development for digital media at Creative Artists Agency. =93In =
many
instances, they get business just because they=92re the ones willing to =
put up
money.=94
=20
Not hindered by lawsuit
In January 2024, the creator app Fanfix sued Passes, alleging the =
company
stole confidential information in order to poach clients. Fanfix also
accused the company of selling content below cost and making misleading
claims about how much money creators were earning by boosting payouts =
with
temporary cash incentives.
=20
According to Guo, Passes offered creators minimum guarantees of two =
times
their income, but on average they saw their revenue grow sevenfold. She
denied that Passes was losing money and said the company was profitable =
at
the time.
=20
=93I think it=92s a one-sided beef, like, it=92s not true, we got no =
trade
secrets,=94 she said. =93They lost like every motion they filed.=94
=20
A lawyer representing Fanfix said the case is active and ongoing.
=20
The suit didn=92t slow the startup=92s growth. In February 2024, Passes =
raised
US$40 million from investors led by Bond Capital.
=20
Passes long had a reputation for allowing edgier content than some other
subscription apps for influencers. It allows bikini pictures and =
suggestive
photos but bars nudity or explicit sexual content, according to company
policies.
=20
Until recently, Passes allowed creators between the ages of 15 and 17 to
sell content on the site. But those policies were changed in February, =
the
same month the company was hit by a class action lawsuit alleging
distribution of child pornography.
=20
The suit was led by Alice Rosenblum, an OnlyFans creator who was 17 at =
the
time she joined Passes. Rosenblum alleged Passes employees, including a
former Fanfix employee, recruited her to create sexually explicit =
content
and then marketed it to users on the site, even though she was underage. =
The
suit also alleges Guo overrode safety controls designed to protect =
underage
creators.
=20
=93The lawsuit, at least as it is related to Passes AND myself, is =
utterly
meritless,=94 Guo said in a lengthy response on X at the time. =93The =
conduct
described in the complaint is a direct violation of our terms of =
service,
content guidelines and everything Passes stands for.=94
=20
Guo maintains she never met or interacted with Rosenblum, and called the
case a =93shakedown=94, saying one of the plaintiffs=92 attorneys once =
represented
her.
=20
Lawyers representing Rosenblum didn=92t respond to a request for =
comment.=20
=20
Tim Humangit, who joined Passes in September 2024 as head of trust and
safety, said the company had planned to remove minors from the site =
before
the lawsuit. At the time, he said, fewer than 1 per cent of its creators =
on
the site were underage.
=20
Today, the company employs about eight full-time staff and 70 contract
workers based in Asia to prevent harmful content from appearing on the =
site.

=20
Meanwhile, Passes has grown to millions of users and thousands of =
creators,
several of whom have become millionaires, according to Seth Melnick, =
chief
business officer.=20
=20
To keep attracting more influencers, management plans to hire more staff =
and
offer creators additional benefits, such as health insurance and wealth
management. Guo=92s goal is to eventually go public.
=20
=93I see it growing much larger than Patreon,=94 Guo said. =93Sorry =
Patreon.=94=20

US trading partners =91dazed and confused=92 after tariff court loss
=20
The legal fight over President Donald Trump=92s global tariffs is =
deepening
after a federal appeals court ruled the levies were issued illegally =
under
an emergency law, extending the chaos in global trade.
=20
A 7-4 decision by a panel of judges Friday night in Washington was a =
major
setback for Trump even as it gives both sides something to boast about.
=20
The majority upheld a May ruling by the Court of International Trade =
that
the tariffs were illegal. But the judges left the levies intact while =
the
case proceeds, as Trump had requested, and suggested that any injunction
could potentially be narrowed to apply only to those who sued.
=20
It=92s unclear exactly where the case goes from here. The Trump =
administration
could quickly appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, or it could allow =
the
trade court to revisit the matter and potentially narrow the injunction
against his tariffs.
=20
=93Our trading partners must be dazed and confused,=94 Wendy Cutler, a =
senior
vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and veteran US trade
negotiator, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. =93Many of them entered into
framework deals with us and some are still negotiating.=94
=20
Trillions of dollars of global trade are embroiled in the case, which =
was
filed by Democratic-led states and a group of small businesses. A final
ruling against Trump=92s tariffs would upend his trade deals and force =
the
government to contend with demands for hundreds of billions of dollars =
in
refunds on levies already paid.
=20
=93It=92s very gratifying,=94 said Elana Ruffman, whose family-owned toy
businesses Learning Resources Inc won a separate lawsuit over Trump=92s
tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or
IEEPA. =93It=92s great that the court agrees with us that the way these =
tariffs
are implemented is not legal.=94
=20
Mollie Sitkowski, a trade lawyer at Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP,
pointed out in a note to clients on Friday that the ruling =93does not
directly apply=94 to tariffs on Brazil or India that were issued under =
the
emergency law and may not address the separate removal of the =93de =
minimis=94
exception for packages valued under US$800.
=20
Friday=92s ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit =
held that
Trump was wrong to issue tariffs under IEEPA, a federal law that the =
panel
concluded was never intended to be used in such a manner. Indeed, the =
court
noted that the law doesn=92t mention tariffs =93or any of its =
synonyms.=94
=20
=93Once again, a court has ruled that the president cannot invent a fake
economic emergency to justify billions of dollars in tariffs,=94 New =
York
Attorney General Letitia James, who is a party to the tariff lawsuit, =
said
in a statement. =93These tariffs are a tax on Americans =97 they raise =
costs for
working families and businesses throughout our country, causing more
inflation and job losses.=94
=20
The ruling applies to Trump=92s =93Liberation Day=94 global tariffs that =
set a 10%
baseline and have been in effect for months that the administration says =
are
meant to address a national emergency around US trade deficits. It =
affects
the extra levies on Mexico, China and Canada that Trump said were =
justified
by the ongoing fentanyl crisis in the US, which he also said was a =
national
emergency under IEEPA.
=20
The decision also covers Trump=92s so-called reciprocal tariffs that =
took
effect Aug 7 for dozens of nations that failed to reach trade deals with =
the
administration by Aug 1. Various carve-outs and extensions have been
announced since then, leaving the final tariffs for some nations up in =
the
air.
=20
Trump=92s tariffs were first ruled illegal in May by the US trade court =
in
Manhattan. That decision was put on hold by the Federal Circuit for the
appeal, allowing the administration to continue threatening tariffs =
during
the negotiations
=20
Hours before Friday=92s ruling dropped, Trump cabinet officials told the
appeals court that a striking down the president=92s tariffs would =
seriously
harm US foreign policy, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying it
would lead to =93dangerous diplomatic embarrassment=94 and undermine =
trade
talks. On Friday night after the court move, Trump posted on X that if =
the
tariffs went away, =93it would be a total disaster for the Country.=94
=20
Cutler, who spent nearly three decades as a diplomat and negotiator at =
the
Office of the US Trade Representative, suggested that the =
administration=92s
concerns about trade deals may now be a reality. She wrote in her post =
that
India, hit by a 50% tariff, =93must be rejoicing,=94 while China =93must =
be
weighing its stance in making concessions in ongoing talks.=94
=20
=93EU efforts to secure domestic approval of its deal may be called into
question, while Japan and Korea whom apparently have made oral deals =
with
little in writing may choose to slow walk current efforts until there is
more US legal clarity, while still pressing for lower auto tariffs,=94 =
Cutler
said.
=20
Stablecoin =97 the US$2 trillion question
=20
It has been all action and adrenaline in the crypto world in recent =
days.
But nowhere has the transformation been more dramatic, or politically
charged, than in the US. Since returning to Washington, US President =
Donald
Trump has moved swiftly: an executive order in January halting the US
Federal Reserve=92s digital dollar efforts; hosting the first-ever White =
House
Crypto Summit in March; and establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, =
among
other crypto-friendly moves. Mid-July, the president signed the GENIUS =
Act
into law, the first major cryptocurrency bill to pass through Congress.
=20
Under his second term, the much-embattled industry has transformed from
regulatory scapegoat to Washington darling. And while this pivot aligns =
with
Trump=92s pre-election campaign promise to make the US the "crypto =
capital of
the world", it marks a striking reversal. As recently as 2021, Trump was
dismissive of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) as a "scam against the dollar".
What changed?
=20
Cynical observers might point to the fact that the crypto industry was =
the
largest corporate donor in the 2024 elections, accounting for nearly =
half of
all corporate contributions. Separately, Forbes reported in June that
roughly 60% of Trump's current net worth is tied to crypto-related =
ventures,
including a 40% stake in blockchain infrastructure company World Liberty
Financial. The company launched the USD1 stablecoin in March this year, =
with
its website proudly proclaiming, "inspired by Trump, powered by USD1".
=20
It is precisely this class of cryptocurrency =97 stablecoins =97 that =
has been
gaining momentum of late, growing at an 86% compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) since 2020. At present, there are US$265 billion stablecoins in
circulation (see Chart 1), and looking ahead, predictions vary from JP
Morgan's conservative US$500 billion to Standard Chartered's US$2 =
trillion
market cap by 2028. In both scenarios, what is clear is that stablecoins =
are
ascendant.
=20
Since its launch in 1Q2025, USD1 has grown to a market cap of US$2.2 =
billion
and is the second-largest US-issued fiat-backed stablecoin in the =
market.
That said, it is but a minor player in the broader stablecoin market
dominated by a duopoly between Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. =
Together,
they account for 86% of the total stablecoin market (see table). Still,
while the Trump-backed USD1 isn't leading the market, it may still be
setting the tone. Its token symbol "USD1" says as much: stablecoins like
USD1 are not designed to replace the greenback, but to digitise and =
extend
its reach. But first, to understand the underlying mechanics.
=20
What is a stablecoin?
=20
Unlike free-floating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, =
stablecoins
are designed to maintain a fixed value =97 typically pegged 1:1 to the =
US
dollar. This peg is upheld either by holding reserves (such as cash, =
T-bills
and other liquid assets) or through algorithmic mechanisms that adjust
supply in response to market conditions (see Chart 2). As such, =
stablecoins
offer the core benefits of blockchain =97 near-instant, low-cost =
transactions
on a 24/7 borderless network =97 without crypto's hallmark volatility. =
Beyond
speed and cost-efficiency, the decentralised nature of blockchain's
underlying digital ledger technology (DLT) also supports transparency =
and
data integrity, while its foundation in cryptographic principles =
safeguards
user-level privacy.
=20
Owing to these functional advantages, stablecoins have become the most
transacted token on-chain, despite representing only a small fraction =
(7%)
of crypto=92s total market cap. In 2024, stablecoin transfers amounted =
to
US$27.6 trillion, outpacing not just Bitcoin (US$19.2 trillion) but also =
the
combined volumes of traditional card networks Visa and Mastercard =
(US$25.5
trillion). To be clear, around 70% of stablecoin transactions were
bot-driven, but this statistic does little to undercut the narrative of =
its
growing relevance. If anything, it underscores the central role that
stablecoins play in powering the automated, smart contract-driven DeFi
(decentralised finance) ecosystem on blockchain. Since their inception,
stablecoins have played a crucial role in the broader crypto ecosystem =
=97
facilitating trades between more volatile cryptocurrencies and serving =
as a
safe haven during periods of market turbulence. BCG reports that 88% of
stablecoin transactions last year were linked to crypto trading, =
arbitrage
and liquidity operations on crypto exchanges. Within this context, USDC
remains the stablecoin of choice.
=20
Real-world adoption
=20
Beyond blockchain, stablecoins have emerged as both an effective store =
of
value and medium of exchange in the real world economy, particularly =
across
emerging markets in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, now the
fastest-growing regions for stablecoin adoption. In structurally weak
economies like Argentina and T=FCrkiye, demand for US dollars has long =
shaped
financial flows, serving as a hedge against inflation and currency
devaluation. But equally, access to the dollar has often been limited,
constrained by underdeveloped banking systems and government =
restrictions.
Argentina's long-standing "Cepo Cambiario", a system of strict currency
controls that was partially lifted this year, is a case in point.
=20
Against this backdrop, stablecoins offer a convenient workaround: a
synthetic US dollar accessible via self-custodial wallets that bypass
traditional banks altogether. This has made them a financial lifeline in
countries where institutional trust and financial infrastructure are
lacking. In T=FCrkiye, for example, stablecoin purchases surged to the
equivalent of 4% of the country's GDP as inflation soared past 60% =
between
June 2023 and 2024.
=20
As a medium of exchange, one of the most transformative use cases for
stablecoins has been in cross-border payments. Today's global financial
system still relies heavily on the SWIFT system, which operates on the
correspondent banking model. In this setup, financial institutions act =
as
intermediaries to route international transfers. SWIFT itself serves as =
the
messaging layer, instructing banks to credit and debit funds on both =
sides
of the transfer. In regions with weak correspondent coverage, payments =
often
pass through multiple intermediary banks, each layering on fees, FX =
mark-ups
and delays tied to mandatory KYC (know your customer) and AML =
(anti-money
laundering) checks. As a result, roughly 40% of SWIFT transactions still
take five days or longer to settle. Beyond major corridors like US-UK,
cross-border transfer costs can exceed 3% of transaction value. Fintechs
like Wise have emerged as cheaper and faster alternatives, but they =
remain
constrained by currency coverage and still expose users to FX spreads =
and
transfer limits.
=20
By contrast, stablecoins enable direct peer-to-peer transfers that =
bypass
intermediaries entirely, cutting costs and drastically accelerating
settlement times. On the Aptos blockchain, USDT transfers can cost as =
little
as US$0.0001 and settle near instantaneously. This efficiency has made
stablecoins increasingly attractive for both individuals and businesses
engaged in cross-border trade.
=20
Looking ahead, another promising use case is machine-to-machine payments
within the emerging agentic economy. At their core, all blockchains =
operate
on programmable =93if-then=94 logic, making them compatible with agentic =
AI
systems that rely on autonomous execution and conditional logic. In May
2025, crypto exchange Coinbase launched "x402", a new stablecoin payment
protocol that allows payments to be made directly over the web. This =
enables
APIs (application programming interfaces), artificial intelligence (AI)
agents and applications to send and receive stablecoins simply by =
visiting a
URL.
=20
Issuers and exchanges
On the regulatory front, stablecoins are finally entering clearer legal
territory. Key jurisdictions have enacted comprehensive legislation,
including the European Union=92s (EU) Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)
Regulation (2023), Singapore=92s Stablecoin Regulatory Framework (2023), =
Hong
Kong=92s Stablecoins Bill (2024) and, most recently, the US GENIUS Act. =
The
latter imposes strict requirements on stablecoin issuers: mandatory =
reserve
backing, regular disclosures, and a prohibition on issuing =
interest-bearing
stablecoins.
=20
In the US, the GENIUS Act forms part of a broader legislative push,
alongside two other bills passed during "Crypto Week" that are now =
awaiting
Senate approval: the CLARITY Act, which adopts a pro-crypto stance by
classifying most cryptocurrencies as commodities, subject to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) oversight; and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, =
which
blocks the development of a Fed-issued central bank digital currency =
(CBDC).
In aggregate, this legislative trio represents the strongest political =
and
regulatory tailwinds for the US=92 crypto market in years. The equity =
markets
have responded in kind: total crypto market cap surged past US$4 =
trillion
for the first time following Crypto Week.
=20
Curiously, however, USDC-issuer Circle saw its stock fall more than 10% =
that
same week. The sell-off came on the heels of a rating downgrade by
investment bank Compass Point, which revised its price target downwards =
from
US$250 to US$130. Even so, the drop raises deeper questions: While the
crypto world may be euphoric, how durable are the business models
underpinning stock prices?
=20
For now, Circle and Coinbase offer the clearest window into how US-based
crypto firms are positioned. Circle is the only pure-play stablecoin =
issuer
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and Coinbase is both the largest
distributor of USDC as well as the US=92 biggest crypto exchange (see =
Chart 3
for how an exchange works). As it stands, Circle is up more than 500% =
since
its blockbuster IPO last month. But a closer look reveals why caution =
may be
warranted. Almost all (99%) of its revenue comes from interest earned on
USDC reserves, mainly T-bills and reverse repos via a BlackRock-managed
money market fund (MMF). While part of the recent decline may reflect
profit-taking after the stock's extraordinary post-IPO rally, what is =
clear
is that Circle remains highly exposed to interest rate cycles. Further, =
the
GENIUS Act=92s ban on yield-bearing stablecoins leaves Circle more =
reliant on
distribution partners to help preserve USDC=92s appeal by offering yield =
to
users through third-party wrappers or platform-based incentives.
=20
In contrast, Coinbase primarily earns revenue from transaction fees on =
its
exchange (see Chart 4). This ties the company's fortunes directly to =
trading
activity, which should rise with stablecoin (and broadly, crypto) =
adoption.
Coinbase also benefits from USDC distribution: under its revenue-sharing
agreement with Circle, Coinbase receives 100% of the reserve income from
USDC circulating on its platform (22% of the total supply, as at 1Q2025) =
as
well as 50% of the remaining reserves income after Circle pays other
partners. Still, Coinbase holds just 7% market share of crypto exchanges
globally, far behind market leader Binance (38%).
=20
Does smart money need =91smart=92 money?
When it comes to traditional finance (TradFi), the rise of blockchain =
has
sparked both complementary and competitive responses. Citi's latest
quarterly call highlights this duality, with a strategy that focuses on =
both
value-added services, such as fiat-crypto (and vice versa) conversions,
digital asset custody and reserve management services, even as =
speculation
continues building about a potential stablecoin consortium between Citi, =
JP
Morgan and Bank of America. Separately, the bank has also been offering
tokenised deposit products since late 2023. And as Citi CEO Jane Fraser
notes, it is the latter =97 tokenised deposits =97 that may offer the =
more
compelling route for traditional financial institutions. While =
researchers
at Galaxy Digital predict at least 10 new stablecoin launches backed by
TradFi players in 2025, the better question isn't if they will succeed =
in
gaining traction, but whether launching a stablecoin even benefits =
TradFi
players in the first place (see sidebar).
=20
Another area attracting institutional interest is the tokenisation of
real-world assets (RWA). In short, this refers to creating digital
representations (or tokens) of traditional financial assets. In fact,
stablecoins are themselves a form of tokenisation, serving as proxies =
for
off-chain assets (the fiat reserves held by issuers) brought onto the
blockchain (see Chart 5). Growing demand is now driving the development =
of
financial products built on tokenised RWA, offering new ways to invest =
using
blockchain infrastructure. Blackrock's USD Institutional Digital =
Liquidity
Fund (BUIDL), a tokenised MMF that launched in 2024, is a leading =
example.
The fund functions as a traditional MMF, investing in dollar-denominated
assets, such as T-bills and cash, but investors buy and sell BUIDL =
tokens
on-chain using USDC. These tokens represent fund ownership, entitling
holders to receive daily yield distribution (dividends) in USDC on the
blockchain (see Chart 6).
=20
Tokenised financial instruments offer the benefits of blockchain such as
faster settlement, 24/7 trading and improved fractionalisation, that is,
lowering investment thresholds. In short, they reduce friction. For
financial institutions, tokenised finance presents a way to retain
traditional clients while tapping into new investor segments. And as =
more
capital migrates on-chain, demand for regulated token-based investment
products is only expected to accelerate.
=20
US dollar dominance
In the near term, no digital currency =97 not even stablecoins =97 has =
emerged
as a definitive winner over fiat, especially the greenback. But as noted =
at
the outset, stablecoins do not disrupt the US dollar's dominance. They
reinforce it. Most (>99%) stablecoins today are pegged to the US dollar =
and
backed by US assets. In the US, this structure is now codified: the =
newly
passed GENIUS Act mandates US-listed stablecoin issuers to hold 100% of
reserves in US assets (T-bills, MMFs and other such approved =
high-quality
liquid assets).
=20
This has four significant implications. First, more stablecoins mean =
more
dollar-based reserves, drawing capital into US financial markets and
reinforcing demand for the US dollar. Ordinarily, a stronger US dollar =
runs
counter to trade policy by making US exports less competitive. But this =
is
perhaps less of a concern under a Trump administration that leans on =
tariffs
to extract trade concessions and boost domestic industries. In fact, a
firmer US dollar cushions the inflationary impact of tariffs, =
effectively
turning stablecoins into an ally to Washington's protectionist agenda.
=20
On another front, demand for stablecoins supports the Fed's ability to =
keep
rates lower. Stablecoin issuers have emerged as significant buyers of US
Treasuries: in 2024, Tether alone ranked as the seventh largest buyer of
T-bills globally. As stablecoins gain further traction, this demand =
could
lower the US government's borrowing costs meaningfully. Empirically, =
large
volumes of USDT issuances have triggered short-term spikes in Treasury
prices, although the effect typically fades within the hour. A separate
study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) quantifies this =
impact
more precisely: US$3.5 billion inflow into stablecoins is expected to =
reduce
the three-month T-bill yield by five basis points over 20 days.
=20
Third, stablecoins expand the US dollar's influence across regions with
limited access to physical greenbacks. This is already playing out in =
parts
of Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, where demand for the dollar is
high, but access has traditionally been constrained as mentioned above. =
As
cross-border stablecoin transactions grow, they function as a digital
extension of the US dollar, bolstering its status as the world's reserve
currency. At the same time, stablecoins serve to undercut the momentum =
for
CBDCs, many of which were envisioned to challenge today's US dollar-led
international payment system.
=20
Finally, and more strategically, stablecoins do not just expand the US
dollar's network, but embed it within global digital infrastructure. =
With
most pegged to USD, the broader ecosystem of wallets, exchanges, payment
rails and DeFi protocols becomes anchored to the US dollar by default. =
Over
time, this dependence gives the US the leverage over access to the =
digital
financial system, a form of control that, as history shows, can =97 and =
has
been =97 weaponised to exert geopolitical power.
=20
On the flipside
Of course, every argument has its wrinkles, and the case for stablecoins =
is
no exception. To start, blockchain technology itself faces foundational
constraints. Much like the "impossible trinity" in international
macroeconomic policymaking, blockchain grapples with its own trilemma: =
the
trade-off between security, scalability and decentralisation. In =
practice,
one of these pillars must be compromised to strengthen the other two.
=20
With broader adoption, scalability becomes the most pressing challenge.
Public blockchains rely on consensus mechanisms where every transaction =
must
be verified and validated by the network. This limits the total number =
of
transactions that can be processed in a single moment. The Ethereum
blockchain, for instance, only processes an upward of 15 transactions =
per
second. And unlike traditional payment networks, where fees are =
typically a
fixed percentage point, stablecoin transfer fees (or gas fees) fluctuate
based on network congestion. As such, growing adoption of blockchain
networks may ironically degrade the very benefits the technology aims to
deliver: speed, efficiency and lower costs.
=20
Of stablecoins specifically, the label "stable" may in fact be something =
of
a misnomer. While they are more stable than most cryptocurrencies, their
pegs have failed in the past due to technical flaws, structural
vulnerabilities or broader market contagion. In May 2022, the collapse =
of
Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST triggered a chain reaction of USDT
redemptions that briefly pushed it off-peg. Less than a year later, USDC
slipped below US$0.90 following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, =
which
held a portion of Circle's reserves. These incidents underscore how =
closely
interwoven stablecoins are within both the crypto and traditional =
banking
systems. And while the US GENIUS Act imposes stricter reserve and =
liquidity
standards, its scope is limited to US-based issuers. Foreign and
non-compliant stablecoins face no trading restrictions for a three-year
grace period =97 an eternity in the crypto world. In the interim, =
incumbent
market leader Tether continues to face persistent scrutiny over its =
opaque
reserves.
=20
The rise of stablecoins also has implications for monetary dynamics in =
the
US. While foreign demand for stablecoins channels capital into US =
assets,
the impact of domestic demand is less straightforward. If inflows into
stablecoins come at the expense of existing bank deposits, traditional
credit creation suffers. Banks rely on deposits to fund loans to the =
real
economy, and deposits that are shifted into stablecoin reduces the size =
of
this pool. Although the overall money supply remains unchanged since
stablecoin issuers must hold equivalent reserves, this effectively =
diverts
capital away from productive lending towards passive liquidity parking. =
On
another front, DeFi speeds up how quickly money changes hands by =
enabling
capital to move between trading, borrowing and yield-generating =
strategies
at a pace traditional finance cannot match. Thus far, the impact of this
faster circulation remains self-contained. As at 2024, less than 5% of
stablecoin transactions involve on- or off-ramps into fiat, meaning
spillover into the real economy remains muted =97 for now.
=20
On a practical level, real-world adoption of stablecoins remains riddled
with frictions. On- and off-ramp conversions can incur up to 7% in
additional transaction fees, eroding their appeal for everyday use. =
While
merchants may benefit from lower payment processing costs, the consumer
proposition is weaker, especially given that traditional systems offer
stickiness through cashback and other reward programmes. The =
irreversible
nature of blockchain transactions also offers no recourse for fraud,
chargebacks or errors.
=20
The bottom line
While the broader public still grapples with distrust towards crypto,
stablecoins present a grounded value proposition by combining the
technological advantages of blockchain with the monetary stability of =
fiat.
Yet, for all the recent market euphoria, most stablecoin activity =
remains
confined within the crypto ecosystem, even as its entanglement with
traditional financial systems deepen.
=20
The leading alternative model of digital money CBDCs has long drawn
criticism for enabling state surveillance and control. But the fact is =
that
delegating core monetary infrastructure and function to private entities
like Circle and Tether raises equally thorny questions about risk and
governance.
=20
What we have explained in this article is the basic workings of =
stablecoins,
their benefits and limitations. We think that over time, stablecoins =
will
gain traction in real world applications, beyond the crypto ecosystem. =
And
therefore, a more relevant question for investors would be =97 how does =
one
profit from this growth? Current players like Circle or Coinbase, or =
shares
of the increasing number of companies adopting crypto treasury strategy?
Perhaps even the traditional banks and payment networks that are looking =
to
issue their own stablecoins and/or facilitate stablecoin transactions? =
The
honest answer is that, at this moment, the winners remain unclear. What =
is
clear, however, is this: should stablecoins continue their current
trajectory and emerge as the dominant form of digital cash, the US =
dollar
will be the ultimate winner. Nearly all stablecoins are currently pegged =
to
the US dollar, far more than the greenback=92s current market shares in =
global
payments and forex reserves (estimated at roughly 50% to 60%). In short, =
a
digitised US dollar will be more deeply embedded in the global financial
system than ever before.

Tokens and coins
While digitalisation and tokenisation are reshaping the financial world,
neither stablecoins nor blockchains are essential to all forms of =
digital
currency. Crucially, it is imperative to distinguish between =
stablecoins,
tokenised deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as they
differ significantly in design, regulatory treatment and underlying =
backing
mechanism.
=20
Tokenised deposits are blockchain-based representations of fiat deposits
issued by commercial banks. They retain the regulatory protections of
traditional deposits, such as FDIC insurance in the US, while gaining =
the
benefits of blockchain. Unlike stablecoins, which are backed by reserve
assets, tokenised deposits are backed by actual bank deposits. This =
means
that tokenised deposit issuances do not compete with the existing =
deposit
base, but in fact reinforces the banking system's role in credit
intermediation. In the US, they also fall outside of the scope of the =
newly
passed GENIUS Act, allowing them to offer yields when linked to
interest-bearing accounts. That said, scalability and interoperability
within the crypto ecosystem remains a key challenge, and broader =
adoption of
tokenised deposits hinges on the development of shared standards (akin =
to
Ethereum's ERC-20 for cryptocurrencies) that can unlock cross-bank and
cross-chain network effects.
=20
CBDCs, on the other hand, are digital sovereign currencies issued by a
country's central bank. They typically come in two main forms: retail =
CBDCs,
intended for general use, and wholesale CBDCs, to facilitate interbank =
and
institutional transfers. As at July 2025, 137 countries are reportedly =
in
the midst of exploring CBDC projects. CBDCs do not necessarily require
blockchain. After all, blockchains were specifically designed to =
establish
consensus in trustless environments, where no central authority exists.
CBDCs by contrast are issued, backed and controlled by central banks, =
with
trust anchored in the authority of the issuing government. China's =
digital
yuan (e-CNY) and India's e-rupee are currently the most advanced pilot
programmes in action. In the US, even as the Anti-CBDC Surveillance =
State
Act advances through Congress, the Federal Reserve remains actively =
involved
in the development of a cross-border wholesale CBDC through Project =
Agor=E1.
The proposed Anti-CBDC Act bans the Fed from issuing a retail CBDC and
stands to make the US a global outlier in CBDC development.

knowledge. Or to quote Albert Einstein, =93Knowledge should be shared. =
It

=20
Summary of key opposing views:
=20
1. It is debatable if the =93US won=94, although it is true that =
=93Trump won=94.
The US has lost beyond its citizens having to pay more due to the =
tariffs.
It lost credibility and standing and has shown the world that it cannot =
be
relied upon. This has long-term adverse consequences to the US.
=20
2. It is debatable if tariffs can lead to sustainable large-scale =
reshoring
of manufacturing activities, given China=92s manufacturing dominance.
=20
3. The deals each country made with the US =97 the devil lies in the =
details.
Many are vague, open-ended =93framework agreements=94 spread over years =
(beyond
US President Donald Trump=92s term) rather than iron-clad deals.
=20
4. It is estimated that US producers, distributors and consumers will =
end up
paying for the bulk of the tariff revenue to be collected by the US
government. Some estimate as high as 80%. Therefore, tariff is in effect =
a
regressive tax, especially if this additional revenue is used to pay for
corporate tax cuts.

In addition to the above summary, we are also printing the written =
response
from Dr Ong Kian Ming.
=20
Response to Tan Sri Tong Kooi Ong=92s article on Trump=92s tariffs :
Tan Sri Tong Kooi Ong=92s column entitled =93Trump wins the trade war =
=97 and the
advantage of future US relative productivity gains=94 (first published =
in The
Edge Malaysia on Aug 18, 2025) is a thought-provoking piece, given that =
it
flies in the face of economics orthodoxy that tariffs are bad for a =
country
in the long term. Given the unprecedented nature of President Trump=92s =
modus
operandi, it is important to analyse the possible effects of his tariff
policy in a rational and unbiased manner, free from our own emotional
reactions to the substance as well as the style of his policy =
announcements.
=20
Firstly, we must acknowledge the possible benefits to the US economy. =
Under
normal circumstances, an unprovoked increase in the tariff rate of one
country against another would usually elicit a response of retaliatory
tariffs from the victimised country. With the exception of China, no =
other
country has dared take a tit-for-tat approach in ramping up its own =
tariffs
against the US in response to Trump=92s reciprocal tariffs. Even the =
mighty
European Union (EU) caved in to make a trade =93deal=94 with Trump. This =
means
that the US government is able to increase its revenues, as much as =
US$300
billion this year and US$600 billion in 2026, from tariffs on imports
without negatively affecting US firms=92 ability to export to other =
countries.
Tong has also pointed out the possible benefits of an increase in
manufacturing investments by US and non-US companies in the long term,
although it will be hard to estimate the value of these =93reshored=94
activities. Trump=92s tactics will also likely increase market access =
for
US-based companies, which will benefit from reduction in tariff lines =
and
lowering of non-tariff barriers by countries, including Malaysia, which =
have
announced trade =93deals=94 with the US.
=20
But there are many =93unknown=94 outcomes that Tong seems to have =
counted as
positives before the eggs have been hatched. It remains to be seen to =
what
extent countries will be able to deliver on =93promises=94 to buy more =
US goods.
For example, Malaysia=92s commitment to buy up to US$150 billion of US =
goods
over the next five years, including Boeing planes and LNG supplies, are
likely purchasing commitments by GLCs (government-linked companies) such =
as
MAS and Petronas that would have taken place regardless of Trump=92s
reciprocal tariffs. It remains to be seen what kinds of formal =
mechanisms
will be put in place by the US Commerce Department to monitor compliance =
for
the many trade =93deals=94 that have been made with various countries. =
It is
also questionable to assume that the Trump tariffs will reduce the US =
trade
deficit in the long run. For this to take place, there must be more
fundamental shifts to the consumption patterns of the average American =
or if
there is a serious economic recession that significantly dampens US
consumption. The overall US trade deficit increased during Trump=92s =
first
presidency and further increased during the Biden presidency despite
continued tariffs on China and the start of more active industrial and
reshoring policies such as the CHIPS Act. (

ecord.html>
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/economy/us-trade-deficit-2024=
-re
cord.html)
=20
More importantly, there are possible negatives associated with the Trump
tariffs that need to be highlighted. Trump=92s unilateral policies have
provided the push for many countries and regions to expand their trade =
ties
and supply chains with one another that will likely leave out the US in =
the
long run. Within the region, Indonesia is likely to conclude its free =
trade
agreement (FTA) negotiations with the EU by the end of this year and the
timelines for the EU FTA negotiations with the Philippines, Thailand and
Malaysia are likely to be shortened as a result of the Trump tariffs.
Ironically, Trump=92s wavering position on Nato and his insistence of EU
countries to increase their defence spending, have spurred the EU to =
seek
greater cooperation with other erstwhile US allies such as Canada, which =
may
shut out US companies from future lucrative defence contracts. Finally,
there is a real danger that the US will ultimately lose out in the
competitiveness battle in the long run, partly because of the =
distortionary
effects of the Trump tariffs, but more so from policies associated with
clamping down on high-skilled immigration and admission of foreign =
students,
especially at the postgraduate level, and the cutting of research =
funding
and staff in key US government agencies such as the National Institutes =
of
Health (NIH).
=20
For Malaysia, Trump=92s policies have opened a new horizon of policy =
debates,
especially with regard to our own approach towards industrial and trade
policies. For this reason, it is important for constructive engagements =
to
continue, including through some of the more provocative views espoused =
in
=93Tong=92s Portfolio=94.

Tether alone ranked as the seventh largest buyer of T-bills globally. As =
stablecoins gain further traction, this demand could lower the US =
government's borrowing costs meaningfully. Empirically, large volumes of =
USDT issuances have triggered short-term spikes in Treasury prices, =
although the effect typically fades within the hour. A separate study by =
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) quantifies this impact more =

stablecoin transactions grow, they function as a digital extension of =
the US dollar, bolstering its status as the world's reserve currency. At =

instance, only processes an upward of 15 transactions per second. And =
unlike traditional payment networks, where fees are typically a fixed =
percentage point, stablecoin transfer fees (or gas fees) fluctuate based =
on network congestion. As such, growing adoption of blockchain networks =

are more stable than most cryptocurrencies, their pegs have failed in =
the past due to technical flaws, structural vulnerabilities or broader =
market contagion. In May 2022, the collapse of Terra's algorithmic =
stablecoin UST triggered a chain reaction of USDT redemptions that =
briefly pushed it off-peg. Less than a year later, USDC slipped below =
US$0.90 following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held a =
portion of Circle's reserves. These incidents underscore how closely =
interwoven stablecoins are within both the crypto and traditional =
banking systems. And while the US GENIUS Act imposes stricter reserve =

stablecoins channels capital into US assets, the impact of domestic =
demand is less straightforward. If inflows into stablecoins come at the =
expense of existing bank deposits, traditional credit creation suffers. =
Banks rely on deposits to fund loans to the real economy, and deposits =
that are shifted into stablecoin reduces the size of this pool. Although =
the overall money supply remains unchanged since stablecoin issuers must =
hold equivalent reserves, this effectively diverts capital away from =
productive lending towards passive liquidity parking. On another front, =
DeFi speeds up how quickly money changes hands by enabling capital to =
move between trading, borrowing and yield-generating strategies at a =
pace traditional finance cannot match. Thus far, the impact of this =
faster circulation remains self-contained. As at 2024, less than 5% of =

it flies in the face of economics orthodoxy that tariffs are bad for a =

style=3D'mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Firstly, we must acknowledge the =
possible benefits to the US economy. Under normal circumstances, an =
unprovoked increase in the tariff rate of one country against another =
would usually elicit a response of retaliatory tariffs from the =
victimised country. With the exception of China, no other country has =
dared take a tit-for-tat approach in ramping up its own tariffs against =
the US in response to Trump&#8217;s reciprocal tariffs. Even the mighty =
European Union (EU) caved in to make a trade &#8220;deal&#8221; with =
Trump. This means that the US government is able to increase its =
revenues, as much as US$300 billion this year and US$600 billion in =
2026, from tariffs on imports without negatively affecting US =
firms&#8217; ability to export to other countries. Tong has also pointed =
out the possible benefits of an increase in manufacturing investments by =
US and non-US companies in the long term, although it will be hard to =
estimate the value of these &#8220;reshored&#8221; activities. =
Trump&#8217;s tactics will also likely increase market access for =
US-based companies, which will benefit from reduction in tariff lines =
and lowering of non-tariff barriers by countries, including Malaysia, =
which have announced trade &#8220;deals&#8221; with the =
US.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p></div><div><p class=3DMsoNormal><span =

v><div><p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal'><span lang=3DEN-US =
style=3D'mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>But there are many =
&#8220;unknown&#8221; outcomes that Tong seems to have counted as =
positives before the eggs have been hatched. It remains to be seen to =
what extent countries will be able to deliver on &#8220;promises&#8221; =
to buy more US goods. For example, Malaysia&#8217;s commitment to buy up =
to US$150 billion of US goods over the next five years, including Boeing =
planes and LNG supplies, are likely purchasing commitments by GLCs =
(government-linked companies) such as MAS and Petronas that would have =
taken place regardless of Trump&#8217;s reciprocal tariffs. It remains =
to be seen what kinds of formal mechanisms will be put in place by the =
US Commerce Department to monitor compliance for the many trade =
&#8220;deals&#8221; that have been made with various countries. It is =
also questionable to assume that the Trump tariffs will reduce the US =
trade deficit in the long run. For this to take place, there must be =
more fundamental shifts to the consumption patterns of the average =
American or if there is a serious economic recession that significantly =
dampens US consumption. The overall US trade deficit increased during =
Trump&#8217;s first presidency and further increased during the Biden =
presidency despite continued tariffs on China and the start of more =
active industrial and reshoring policies such as the CHIPS Act. =

style=3D'mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>More importantly, there are possible =
negatives associated with the Trump tariffs that need to be highlighted. =
Trump&#8217;s unilateral policies have provided the push for many =
countries and regions to expand their trade ties and supply chains with =
one another that will likely leave out the US in the long run. Within =
the region, Indonesia is likely to conclude its free trade agreement =
(FTA) negotiations with the EU by the end of this year and the timelines =
for the EU FTA negotiations with the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia =
are likely to be shortened as a result of the Trump tariffs. Ironically, =
Trump&#8217;s wavering position on Nato and his insistence of EU =
countries to increase their defence spending, have spurred the EU to =
seek greater cooperation with other erstwhile US allies such as Canada, =
which may shut out US companies from future lucrative defence contracts. =
Finally, there is a real danger that the US will ultimately lose out in =
the competitiveness battle in the long run, partly because of the =
distortionary effects of the Trump tariffs, but more so from policies =
associated with clamping down on high-skilled immigration and admission =
of foreign students, especially at the postgraduate level, and the =
cutting of research funding and staff in key US government agencies such =
as the National Institutes of Health =
(NIH).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p></div><div><p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
