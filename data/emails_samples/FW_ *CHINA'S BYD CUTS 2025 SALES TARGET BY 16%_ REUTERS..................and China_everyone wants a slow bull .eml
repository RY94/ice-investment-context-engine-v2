Ouch..the bad boy in the EV involution game paying the price? BYD stock down
1.5%, which is modest against overall market, as  stock has been on
correction mode in last few sessions. 

Earlier, Bloomberg  article below set off  profit taking with winner
stocks/sectors are down more in morning trade -  Alibaba -3%, Popmart -3%,
hot biotech names like Hengrui, Duality, Akeso, Hansoh down 5~7%, robotics
names like Horizon Robotics down 5%, hot favorite dividend name China
Hongqiao ~7%,  ...... profit taking trades. 

Net-net, China wants a SLOW BULL..infact everyone prefers a slow bull.
Question is can China Inc engineer such a "slow bull" market. Fingers
Crossed!

China Eyes Curbs on Stock Speculation to Foster Steady Gains (1)
Summary by Bloomberg AI
*	China's financial regulators are considering cooling measures for
the stock market due to concerns about the speed of a $1.2 trillion rally
since the start of August.
*	The proposed measures include the removal of some short selling
curbs and options to rein in speculative trading to prevent heavy losses on
retail investors.
*	Regulators have already taken steps such as drafting financial
institutions to investigate the illicit use of credit funds and ordering
brokerages to refrain from aggressively touting their services.
China's financial regulators are considering a number of cooling measures
for the stock market as they grow concerned about the speed of a $1.2
trillion rally since the start of August, people familiar with the matter
said. The measures proposed to top policymakers in recent weeks include the
removal of some short selling curbs, the people said, asking not to be
identified as the information is private. Authorities are also contemplating
options to rein in speculative trading on concern a sharp reversal might
inflict heavy losses on retail investors. With an epic boom and bust from
2015 not forgotten, officials are seeking to cultivate steadier gains that
will help revive the economy and consumer sentiment. The deliberations also
coincided with China's push to show off its military might at a Sept. 3
parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The
government often seeks to instill stability in its capital markets around
major national events.
China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Wu Qing signaled
determination to ensure stock market stability at a symposium he convened in
Beijing at the end of last month, pledging to consolidate the "positive
momentum" of the market, while promoting "long-term, value, and rational
investing."
It's unclear if any of the measures will be approved or adopted, said the
people. The CSRC didn't immediately reply to a faxed request for a comment. 
China's stock market has staged a comeback since April, with major indexes
gaining more than 20%. The Shanghai Composite Index hit a decade-high and
the CSI 300 Index has surged more than 20% from this year's low. Both gauges
slipped more than 1% Thursday morning. The offshore yuan edged lower. The
currency rallied to its strongest level since November last week, partially
fueled by market expectation that gains in Chinese stocks will support the
yuan by attracting more foreign inflows. While the onshore indexes have
lagged other global benchmarks for the year, there are signs of froth in
China's $12.5 trillion market that have some parallels to 2015. That painful
memory, coupled with China's economic strains and US tariff threats, give
authorities all the more reason to take a cautious approach in engineering a
sustainable run without spooking investors. Regulators have already drafted
the nation's financial institutions to help achieve that goal. Banks were
asked to investigate the illicit use of credit funds in stocks after
regulators' monitoring found some investors have piled in with money
borrowed from online credit platforms, according to people familiar with the
matter.  Brokerages were ordered to refrain from aggressively touting their
round-the-clock services to help open new stock accounts, said the people.
Flocking to the market, retail investors opened 166% more new accounts in
August than the same month last year, according to exchange data. In an
early sign that the regulators could be getting more hands on, Ningbo TIP
Rubber Technology Co., which had gained the 10% limit for nine sessions
straight, suspended trading on Thursday, citing a need to protect investor
interests after abnormal fluctuations. Artificial intelligence chip designer
Cambricon Technologies Corp., seen as one of the targets of speculation,
warned investors last week about risks in trading its stock. Social media
platforms were also alerted not to overly publicize content on the bull
market, margin transactions hitting a new high, and rising reallocations of
bank deposits into stocks, to avoid stirring up novice investors, people
with knowledge of the matter said. Any violations and illegal stock
recommendations will be severely punished, they said.
 China's ubiquitous WeChat app pledged to restrict traffic or ban certain
accounts after some were found to have illegally offered stock
recommendation services or lured users with fabricated and misleading
information, according to a late August statement. Over 400 mutual fund
products have either announced a halt or cap in subscriptions in August,
local media have reported. Trading volumes on mainland exchanges hit more
than 3.1 trillion yuan ($434 billion) on Aug. 27, the second highest ever,
while margin transactions have reached record levels, surpassing 2015. Much
of the run is liquidity driven and defying China's economic fundamentals
from entrenched deflation to a persistent property crisis, triggering bubble
warnings from market watchers.
Some financial firms have moved to cut the leverage for margin traders, who
sent stocks soaring in 2015 before a clampdown on such activities triggered
a crash. In the first such public move, Shanghai-based Sinolink Securities
Co. raised its margin deposit ratio on new client financing contracts for
some securities to 100% from 80% starting Aug. 27. For now, regulators might
still have some buffer room before they take any actions to intervene, as
some argue the recent run is not retail-driven like in the 2015 round. Citic
Securities Co., one of the nation's top brokerages, said smart money such as
high-net worth individuals or corporate investors have piled in via hedge
funds, constituting the main drivers of stock gains. The rally so far also
appears to be limited to some strategic sectors such as chips rather than
broad-based, analysts led by Qiu Xiang wrote in an Aug. 25 note. "The
probabilities for the current rally to be short-lived after a quick
acceleration or broaden out are both low," they wrote.  New A-share account
openings in August still significantly lag behind a previous high in
October, when China's pro-growth policies ushered in 6.8 million new
investors, marking the third-strongest month on record.  There's no sign of
a retail fund influx yet, but the market might be nearing a point where
we'll see some household savings pouring in, Western Securities analyst Cao
Liulong wrote in an Aug. 24 report. The market may then consolidate for
around two to three months, before resuming the rally on the

style=3D'font-size:11.0pt'>China&#8217;s stock market has staged a =
comeback since April, with major indexes gaining more than 20%. The =
Shanghai Composite Index hit a decade-high and the CSI 300 Index has =
surged more than 20% from this year&#8217;s low.&nbsp;Both gauges =
slipped more than 1% Thursday morning. The offshore yuan edged lower. =
The currency rallied to its strongest level since November last week, =
partially fueled by market&nbsp;expectation&nbsp;that gains in Chinese =
stocks will support the yuan by attracting more foreign inflows. While =
the onshore indexes have lagged other global benchmarks for the year, =
there are signs of froth in China&#8217;s $12.5 trillion market that =
have some parallels to 2015. That painful memory, coupled with =
China&#8217;s economic strains and US tariff threats, give authorities =
all the more reason to take a cautious approach in engineering a =
sustainable run without spooking investors. Regulators have already =
drafted the nation&#8217;s financial institutions to help achieve that =
goal. Banks were asked to investigate the illicit use of credit funds in =
stocks after regulators&#8217; monitoring found some investors have =
piled in with money borrowed from online credit platforms, according to =
people familiar with the matter.&nbsp; Brokerages were ordered to =
refrain from aggressively touting their round-the-clock services to help =
open new stock accounts, said the people. Flocking to the market, retail =
investors opened 166% more new accounts in August than the same month =
last year, according to exchange data. In an early sign that the =
regulators could be getting more hands on, Ningbo TIP Rubber Technology =
Co., which had gained the 10% limit for nine sessions straight, =
suspended trading on Thursday, citing a need to protect investor =
interests after abnormal fluctuations. Artificial intelligence chip =
designer Cambricon Technologies Corp., seen as one of the targets of =
speculation,&nbsp;warned&nbsp;investors last week about risks in trading =
its stock. Social media platforms were also alerted not to overly =
publicize content on the bull market, margin transactions hitting a new =
high, and rising reallocations of bank deposits into stocks, to avoid =
stirring up novice investors, people with knowledge of the matter said. =
Any violations and illegal stock recommendations will be severely =
punished, they said.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p =

found to have illegally offered stock recommendation services or lured =
users with fabricated and misleading information, according to a late =
August statement. Over&nbsp;400&nbsp;mutual fund products have either =
announced a halt or cap in subscriptions in August, local media have =
reported. Trading volumes&nbsp;on mainland exchanges hit more than 3.1 =
trillion yuan ($434 billion) on Aug. 27, the second highest ever, while =
margin transactions have reached record levels, surpassing 2015. Much of =
the run is liquidity driven and defying China&#8217;s economic =
fundamentals from entrenched deflation to a persistent property crisis, =
triggering&nbsp;bubble warnings&nbsp;from market =
watchers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=3DMsoNormal><span =

leverage for margin traders, who sent stocks soaring in 2015 before a =
clampdown on such activities triggered a crash. In the first such public =
move, Shanghai-based&nbsp;Sinolink Securities Co.&nbsp;raised its margin =
deposit ratio on new client financing contracts for some securities to =
100% from 80% starting Aug. 27. For now, regulators might still have =
some buffer room before they take any actions to intervene, as some =
argue the recent run is not retail-driven like in the 2015 round. Citic =
Securities Co., one of the nation&#8217;s top brokerages, said smart =
money such as high-net worth individuals or corporate investors have =
piled in via hedge funds, constituting the main drivers of stock gains. =
The rally so far also appears to be limited to some strategic sectors =
such as chips rather than broad-based, analysts led by Qiu Xiang wrote =
in an Aug. 25&nbsp;note. &#8220;The probabilities for the current rally =
to be short-lived after a quick acceleration or broaden out are both =
low,&#8221; they wrote.&nbsp; New A-share account openings in August =
still significantly lag behind a previous high in October, when =
China&#8217;s pro-growth policies ushered in 6.8 million new investors, =
marking the third-strongest month on record.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no sign =
of a retail fund influx yet, but the market might be nearing a point =
where we&#8217;ll see some household savings pouring in, Western =
Securities analyst Cao Liulong wrote in an Aug. 24&nbsp;report. The =
