     *=C2=A0Markets:

          *=C2=A0Greater China stocks sharply lower Thursday. Hang Seng (1.=
12%), Shanghai Composite (1.25%), Shenzhen (2.83%),
            ChiNext (4.25%). In mainland markets, STAR 50 index plunged 6% =
amid tech sell-off, blue chips and small caps
            posted similar declines. Telecommunication services, semiconduc=
tors, information technology all plunged.
            Cambricon Technologies (688256.CH) fell 14.5%. Banks were highe=
r. Turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen rose to
            CNY2.54T($356B) from CNY2.36T in prior session. In Hong Kong, b=
anks eked out mild gains, while innovative drugs,
            biotech, and information technology were all sharply down. Hang=
 Seng Tech underperformed benchmark. Yuan edged up
            slightly against dollar.
          *=C2=A0Chinese stocks tumbled, extending declines into third stra=
ight session as investors booked profits on the rally
            that had added $1.2T to market value since start of August, pro=
mpting potential regulatory curbs on stock
            speculation. End of Victory Day parade on Wednesday added to pr=
ofit-taking as investors had expected authorities
            to ensure capital market stability ahead of the key event. Sent=
iment in Hong Kong-listed stocks also soured,
            partly due to lackluster earnings results, on top of concerns t=
hat Chinese regulators will intervene to cool down
            excessive stock gains on the mainland.

     *=C2=A0Equities:

          *=C2=A0China mulls cooling measures to rein in stock speculation:=
 Bloomberg reported China's financial regulators are
            considering curbs on stock speculation as bubble risks grow fro=
m a $1.2T rally since start of August. Measures
            proposed to top policymakers include removal of some short-sell=
ing curbs and some other options to restrain
            speculative trading. Regulators have already asked brokers to r=
efrain from aggressively promoting round-the-clock
            services to help open new stock accounts and urged social media=
 platforms not to overly publicize content such as
            "bull market", "margin transactions hitting new high" and "shif=
ting bank deposits into stocks".
          *=C2=A0Nasdaq revamps listing rules for Chinese companies and sma=
ll IPOs: Bloomberg reported Nasdaq would require at
            least $25M public offering proceeds for new listings of Chinese=
 companies as part of proposed rules submitted to
            SEC for approval. Two other changes were raising minimum compan=
y public float to $15M from current threshold of
            at least $5M and accelerating process of suspending and de-list=
ing companies with market value of listed
            securities below $5M. Moves came amid growing scrutiny over sha=
rp moves in publicly traded companies with
            relatively small market capitalization and scant liquidity and =
follow review of emerging patterns associated with
            potential pump-and-dump schemes in US cross-market trading envi=
ronments.

     *=C2=A0Trade:

          *=C2=A0China to impose tariffs on certain types of US single-mode=
 optical fiber: Reuters reported China's commerce
            ministry said country will levy tariffs of up to 78.2% on certa=
in US optical fiber imports from 4-Sep, accusing
            US producers of skirting anti-dumping measures. Levies cover a =
type known as cut-off shifted single-mode optical
            fiber, singling out Corning (GLW), OFS-Felite and Drake Communi=
cations for rates of 37.9%, 33.3% and 78.2%
            respectively, with other American companies also paying the hig=
hest rate.

     *=C2=A0Technology:

          *=C2=A0China tech firms still want Nvidia's chips despite governm=
ent discouragement: Reuters reported Alibaba (9988.HK),
            ByteDance and other Chinese tech companies are still keen to bu=
y Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips despite regulators in
            Beijing strongly discouraging them from such purchases. These c=
ompanies want reassurance that their orders of H20
            models are being processed and closely monitoring Nvidia's plan=
 to sell a more powerful chip, potentially named
            B30A that based on Blackwell architecture. Demand for Nvidia's =
products remains strong partly due to supply
            constraints from domestic rivals such as Huawei and Cambricon. =
And some have also pointed to better performance
            in Nvidia's products.
