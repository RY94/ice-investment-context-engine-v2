Hi all,

 

Please find below the notes from Soilbuild's call (by Darren) and
supplemented by the meeting this morning. 

 

*	Are margins that we saw in 1H25 normalized?

*	The Group tends to secure and lock in raw material and subcon for
6months to a 1 year upon winning the tender to reduce volatilities in
expenses 
*	Margins have more or less stabilized since 2023
*	Upside of margins would come from their operational efficiency 
*	GPM has increased steadily since 2023 from 9% in FY23 to 12% in FY23
to 16% in 1H25
*	When they secure and execute project at a larger scale, mid teens
GPM and above are the type of margins to expect

 

*	Pipeline of projects

*	Currently they are tendering for 4 projects amounting over S$1bn to
conclude by end of year
*	They won't win all 4, but hopefully able to win 1. Sounded like 1-2
is what their base expectation is.
*	Tender contract win period should be awarded around 4Q25 and later.
*	1 MRO (aviation industry), 1 maintenance facility, 2 dormitory
projects (he is not 100% sure on the figures offhand but 6000 / 10000 beds
for the 2 projects).
*	Not bogged down by value of orderbook but 7-9 projects at a time is
typical for them. If higher, they would have to hire new teams / project
managers.

 

*	What is the success rate of tendering for orders

*	Don't have a fixed % to share

 

*	Current orderbook, what is the timeline for the projects to be
completed

*	Current orderbook is S$1.2bn, conclude by 1H27
*	Run rate should be S$300mn per half +/- (on average) - mgmt
mentioned S$1.2bn spread across a straight line to 1H27

 

*	Competitors

*	Main ones are Precise Development & Boustead
*	Followed by Tiong Seng / Lian Beng ("encounter them at times")
*	China guys like China Harbour
*	Japanese guys "cant compete on pricing"

 

*	Competitive advantage

*	Digitalisation + sustainability
*	In all tenders, they have a full 3D model (not proprietary, off the
shelf solution) to show the clients the actual building that they will build
along with the location of their production equipment etc so that they can
plan beforehand to reduce back and forth changes
*	5% evaluation points in the tender process is on sustainability.
This 5% is significant as contracts are typically quite close when it comes
to the final score. Historically, sustainability angle has been mainly for
operating the building (after construction). But they are able to construct
more sustainably than others (took them 1.5 years to build out this
sustainability angle, so they are ahead of the curve, competitors will
eventually do so too).
*	DB Schenker building, they went up against Boustead / Tiong Seng /
Lian Beng, and it's this digital + sustainability angle that won them the
bid.

 

*	Not looking to venture overseas

*	"could be an expensive lesson to learn"
*	Need to know local authorities and construction is a "very local
business"
*	If we were to venture overseas, we will probably start with a local
partner

 

*	Tuas project (S$647.5mn contract size)

*	Less than 20% of the contract size has been recognized till date.
*	Will last till 1H27 (longer than their usual contract)

 

*	Areas of focus for Soilbuild 

*	The Group prefers to focus on industrial projects- in particular
high specs industrial projects, manufacturing facilities 

*	PSA ports 
*	db Schenker

*	The Group is able to work on DC type of projects

*	Pall Lion is A&A work, provide water supply to semicon 
*	Soitec are pure semicon projects

*	They are focusing on industrial projects

*	3 public and 1 private 

*	The Group does not rule out any private residential projects
*	The company is targeting to maintain S$1bn orderbook 
*	Private commercial projects like T5 and MBS IR are not their
targets. They go for "above ground" projects which is in their circle of
competence + infra projects they deem to be too lengthy (5-7 years). Their
usual contracts are 24 months.

 

*	Precast business, growing quite rapidly for both SG and Msia. What
is the trend going forward

*	Msia precast supports their SG business 
*	The growing trend is a result of more HDB projects coming online.
They have been strong for securing HDB projects and some external clients   
*	The SG production capacity is filled till 1H26 (99% utilization)
*	Malaysia utilization around 65-70% (so there's no intention to capex
as the Malaysia plant is able to support).
*	Most of the precast capacity is for their external customers 
*	When asked on the topic of a potential spinoff: this is a separate
entity so in theory they wont rule out spinning off. But it doesn't sound
like its their near term intention.

 

*	Dividend 

*	No formal dividend policy 
*	Past payout averaging 30%

 

*	What are your plans for capital management with the cash 

*	They are more prudent, if there are excess cash at the end of the
year, they might distribute as dividend 
*	PSA job is slightly cash flow intensive, so having more cash would
help them tide through the project better 

 

*	How are the margins between construction and precast, is there
breakdown in orderbook. 

*	Precast is about S$200mn, the rest is construction 
*	Margins can be seen in the segment reporting note 

 

*	Which area do we see stronger growth, is it public or private

*	Public sector: HDB- ramping up more BTOs. More infrastructure, but
these are not their focus
*	The Group is targeting private industrial projects

*	They see growth in the next 3-5 years as SG wants to focus on
advance manufacturing 

 

*	Capital management- what is the priority

*	They currently only have 1 long term debt, but they are still
evaluating on that
*	As interest rates are on the decline, they might renew some term
loans 
*	With the cash on hand, they are also earning interest income (the
financial controller mentioned "preferential rates") to offset interest
expense 
*	Having more cash on hand would provide them with better options  

 

*	Given stronger construction activity, are there any areas of
bottlenecks and delays. What are the strategies to overcome them?

*	Labour is one potential bottleneck as there are a lot of mega
project out there 
*	There are some labour shortages from their subcon 
*	They are splitting their packages into smaller sizes to allow their
subcon to manage well 

*	This is to manage subcon risks of delays/cost overrun 

 

*	Are there any areas of lowering cost

*	Workers' dorm prices have not been cheap recently 
*	They will continue to monitor material prices, try to lock in at
cheaper prices

 

*	Soilbuild has built 1000 bed, is it purely for Tuas project or
mainly for internal

*	Mainly for their PSA project, they have 1500 workers- all their
subcons etc

 

*	Are there any plans to increase the share float? Would the company
be looking to do share placement 

*	Their float is low, they are open for some corporate action
(potential placement to increase the float) 

 

*	Are you able to share more on the competitive landscape- like
Chinese contractors 

*	China Communication, China Habour have been very active
*	Within their focus, they compare with China Communications and China
Habour. So far as they have been diving prices. But despite that, Soilbuild
won via sustainability and quality despite having a higher price 

 

*	Subcon vs internal workers

*	PSA > 1500 workers (100 are own workers) 
*	Majority will be subcon 

 

*	Max orderbook the Group can take on 

*	Typically they will manage around 7-9 projects at one go 
*	Increasing the number of projects would depend on hiring more
project managers and workers

 

*	Can we expect admin expense to increase substantially 

*	More or less stabilize with FY25, unlikely to have significant
increase going forward

 

*	High spec seems like high margins, what type of margins typically
for these types of contracts

*	Won't be able to share the margins as it is confidential 
*	They usually have a baseline margins, after they win the projects,
they will optimize to get better margins 

 

*	Tender process: 

*	When they tender, they get contract specs 
*	The Group will ask for quotes from subcon for a particular trade 
*	Then they will go for tender
*	Whenever they get quotes for subcon, usually it is not the best
pricing. When the projects are secured, the subcon will lower prices as they
are hungry for jobs, that is where they will optimize the margins

*	Working capital requirements for PSA?

*	They do claim on progress payment on months' work 
*	Because of their strong cashflow, they do not see any risks
