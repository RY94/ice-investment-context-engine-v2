Europe: Stoxx 600 ends higher on defence boost; Novo Nordisk jumps after =
Wegovy data
European shares finished marginally higher on Monday (Sep 1), supported =
by defence stocks, while Novo Nordisk gained after data showed its =
weight-loss drug Wegovy delivers stronger heart-protective benefits than =
Eli Lilly=E2=80=99s rival therapies.
=20
The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed up 0.23 per cent at 551.43, with gains =
led by the aerospace and defence index, which surged 2.1 per cent to =
hover near a record high.
=20
Defence giants, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Rheinmetall and Hensoldt advanced =
between 2.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent.
=20
Gains followed a Financial Times report that European Commission =
President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe was preparing =
=E2=80=9Cpretty precise plans=E2=80=9D to send troops to Ukraine as part =
of post-conflict security guarantees.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe possibility of additional support for Ukraine can only be =
beneficial as far as (European) stocks are concerned and investors are =
really buying into that,=E2=80=9D said Fiona Cincotta, senior market =
analyst at City Index.
=20
Britain=E2=80=99s BAE Systems was up 1.8 per cent, as Norway said that =
it had chosen Britain for the acquisition of new frigates, in a deal =
worth some =C2=A310 billion (S$17 billion).
=20
Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, the fourth-largest healthcare company on =
the Stoxx index, rose 1.8 per cent after the company said that Wegovy =
cut the risk of heart attack, stroke or death by 57 per cent versus Eli =
Lilly=E2=80=99s rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound in a real-world =
comparison.
=20
The stock bolstered the healthcare index, rising 0.27 per cent. =
Denmark=E2=80=99s main stock index gained 1.1 per cent, also aided by =
Novo=E2=80=99s domestic peer Zealand Pharma that ended 3.5 per cent =
higher.
=20
Overall gains were limited by a jump in long-dated euro zone bond yields =
on persistent worries about government debt levels around the world.
=20
Germany=E2=80=99s 30-year yield rose as much as to a 14-year peak of =
3.381 per cent before cooling to 3.36 per cent, up two basis points.
=20
Utilities, often traded as a bond proxy, fell 0.9 per cent to lead =
sectoral losses on the Stoxx 600.
=20
Meanwhile, US tariff policy remained a key focus after a US appeals =
court ruled on Friday that most of US President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s =
tariffs are illegal, but left them in place until mid-October to permit =
further appeals.
=20
Trump has vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court and trade experts =
say the administration is preparing alternative plans to be able to =
proceed with its tariffs.
=20
The European Union has struck a deal with the US, while the Swiss =
continue to negotiate, although broader trade uncertainty has subsided =
since April.

Goldman Sachs was the latest among major brokerages to raise its Stoxx =

=20
Orsted gained 3.5 per cent after Norway=E2=80=99s Equinor pledged to =

navigate regulatory hurdles in the US offshore wind market.

On the data front, euro zone manufacturing activity expanded in August =
for the first time since mid-2022 due to a surge in domestic demand and =

Oil settles higher on weaker US dollar and Russian supply disruptions
[NEW YORK] Global benchmark Brent crude oil settled 1 per cent higher on =
Monday (Sep 1), as concerns mounted that intensifying airstrikes in =
Russia and Ukraine could lead to supply disruptions, and as a weaker US =
dollar lent additional support.
=20
Brent crude futures settled up 67 US cents, or 1 per cent, at US$68.15 a =
barrel. The US benchmark, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures =
contract, was up 67 US cents, or 1.1 per cent at US$64.68 by 2.15 pm ET.
=20
There will be no settlement for WTI futures on Monday due to Labor Day =
holiday in the US Trading volume for both Brent and WTI was also muted =
due to that reason.
=20
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday vowed to retaliate =
against Russian drone strikes on power facilities in his =
country=E2=80=99s north and south, and ordered more strikes deep inside =
Russia.
=20
Three and a half years into the war, both Russia and Ukraine have =
intensified airstrikes in recent weeks, even as efforts are underway to =
resolve the crisis.
=20
Markets remain concerned about Russian oil flows, with weekly shipments =
from its ports dropping to a four-week low of 2.7 million barrels per =
day (bpd), according to tanker tracker data cited by ANZ analysts.
=20
Elsewhere, the US labour market report this week will give a read on the =
economy=E2=80=99s health and test investor confidence that interest rate =
cuts are coming soon, a view that has strengthened appetite for riskier =
assets such as commodities.
=20
Ahead of the data, the US dollar was close to a five-week low on Monday, =
making oil less expensive for buyers using other currencies.
=20
Investors were also focused on Beijing, where Chinese President Xi =
Jinping, Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister =
Narendra Modi are attending a regional summit.
=20
China=E2=80=99s manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in =
August in five months, a private-sector survey showed on Monday. That =
helped lend support to oil and copper prices, SEB commodities analyst =
Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note to clients on Monday.
=20
Also on the radar was an Opec+ meeting on Sep 7.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe next key fundamental question is whether Opec+ oil =
producers will continue to raise the group=E2=80=99s output targets =
beyond September, with a decision due within days,=E2=80=9D analyst Tim =
Evans said in the newsletter Evans on Energy.
=20
Coming out of the summer season, oil inventories should rise in the last =
quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, HSBC analysts said in a =
note, with a surplus of 1.6 million barrels per day in the fourth =
quarter.
=20
Higher Opec+ supply and rising stockpiles could keep pressure on oil =
prices after both Brent and WTI registered their first monthly declines =
in four months in August, losing 6 per cent or more.
=20
=E2=80=9COil practitioners will continue to curb their =
enthusiasm,=E2=80=9D PVM analyst John Evans said in a note, citing the =
increased Opec+ supply. REUTERS

AsiaPhos to acquire property development company for $59.42 mil in =
reverse takeover bid
=20
AsiaPhos Limited sets out to acquire Exquisite Mode, a property =
development company, for $59.42 million from United Malayan Land.
=20
This proposed acquisition is expected to result in a reverse takeover of =
AsiaPhos, which is subject to approval of shareholders at an EGM.
=20
Evolve Capital Advisory has been appointed as financial adviser and =
sponsor in relation to the proposed acquisition.
=20
Exquisite Mode has an issued and paid-up share capital of RM253.1 =
million comprising 19,361,000 ordinary shares, 97.41% owned by United =
Malayan Land and 2.59% owned by Musa Michael Lee Abdullah.
=20
It owns and or manages assets of the following: an eleven (11) storey =
5-star hotel tower comprising 242 rooms identified as Amari Johor Bahru; =
ninety-two (92) units of serviced residences/suites; a two-storey retail =
podium; and four hundred ninety-six (496) car parking bays, all of which =
are located within the integrated development known as Suasana Iskandar.
=20
AsiaPhos says that it has been striving to mitigate external risks and =
pursue sustained growth for its trading business, particularly in light =
of increasing geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in global trade =
policies. Following its acquisition in August 2024 of a new subsidiary =
engaged in the wholesale trade of fertilisers, it has been seeking =
suitable and profitable corporate, business and financing opportunities =
to enhance shareholders=E2=80=99 value.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe board believes that the proposed acquisition will provide =
an opportunity for the company to venture into a new business area that =
has potential for growth,=E2=80=9D the release reads. In addition, =
Exquisite Mode=E2=80=99s proven track record of profitability will =
enhance the long-term interests of AsiaPhos, it adds.
=20
Exquisite Mode=E2=80=99s assets are also in close proximity to the Johor =
Rapid Transit System (RTS) station, which positions AsiaPhos to ride on =
the future growth of the Singapore=E2=80=93Johor Special Economic Zone, =
which is expected to drive demand for quality real estate, hospitality =
and related services.

=20
City Developments Limited (CDL)=E2=80=99s wholly-owned subsidiary Ascent =

Properties, the holding company of South Beach Consortium.
=20
Ascent View Holdings sold its 50.1% stake to IOI Properties Group, which =

Transparency and prudence guide ValueMax shares to record high
CFO Carol Liew has played a pivotal role in the company=E2=80=99s =
success, having gradually cultivated these values since taking office in =
2012=20
=20
[SINGAPORE] Shares of pawnbroker ValueMax have been on a tear.
=20
After a 33 per cent jump in 2024, the counter has climbed another 94.2 =
per cent so far this year to hit an all-time high.
=20
Did ValueMax get lucky? Or is it merely a beneficiary of wider =
macroeconomic trends?
=20
ValueMax=E2=80=99s success, the group believes, is due to its commitment =
to transparency and prudence. And for this, chief financial officer =
(CFO) Carol Liew has played a pivotal role =E2=80=93 having gradually =
cultivated these values since taking office in 2012.
=20
Liew was awarded the Best CFO for mid-cap companies in 2024 for playing =
a significant role in supporting, advocating and promoting good =
corporate governance, disclosure and transparency.
=20
Liew told The Business Times that transparency with shareholders and =
creditors is a core part of the company=E2=80=99s strategy.
=20
Shareholders need to understand what is going on through financial =
statements, she said.
=20
=E2=80=9CWhen we do rights issues and capital exercises, we are very =
well supported by our shareholders,=E2=80=9D she added.
=20
But ValueMax needs to look to its creditors too, which Liew acknowledged =
was =E2=80=9Cequally as important=E2=80=9D.
=20
=E2=80=9CWhen they=E2=80=99re comfortable with us, they know where we =
are at, how we handle things and they see how we prudently manage our =
finances. Creditors will be comfortable in supporting our growth through =
extending to us more facilities,=E2=80=9D she noted.
=20
According to their financial report, over 95 per cent of =
ValueMax=E2=80=99s loan book is backed by tangible assets such as gold, =
diamonds and properties.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe monitor the gold price movement very closely, and we also =
apply prudent loan-to-value ratios,=E2=80=9D she said, noting that the =
assets are not just for converting, but also for its money-lending =
business.
=20
ValueMax has a relatively prudent debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3, which is =
=E2=80=9Cconservatively leveraged=E2=80=9D within the pawnbroking =
industry, noted the FY2024 report. However, the loan-to-value ratio was =
not explicitly stated in their financial reports.
=20
Retail and trading of jewellery and gold was a very significant growth =
driver for ValueMax in H1 2025, contributing around S$204.8 million in =
revenue, up 17.5 per cent from a year ago. It only accounts for one out =
of three of its core business segments, with the others being its =
pawnbroking and money-lending segments.
=20
The company=E2=80=99s pawnbroking segment was up 20.2 per cent to S$28.1 =
million, while revenue from the money-lending segment rose 10.7 per cent =
to S$35.4 million. Overall, its H1 2025 revenue was up 16.8 per cent to =
S$268.3 million, compared with S$229.8 million a year ago.
=20
Not a sunset industry
=E2=80=9CPawnbroking, compared to 15 years ago, is very =
different,=E2=80=9D Liew said.
=20
In the past, pawnshops were associated with dimly lit premises and =
counters with metal bars to prevent theft =E2=80=93 it was slightly =
daunting, she said.
=20
=E2=80=9CYou did not want to be caught outside a pawnshop, as it was not =
a very good image,=E2=80=9D she added.
=20
But times have changed and now pawnshops have changed their focus to =
look more =E2=80=9Cretail=E2=80=9D, she said, noting that they should no =
longer be seen as a =E2=80=9Clast resort=E2=80=9D.
=20
=E2=80=9CEvery pawner is actually an asset owner,=E2=80=9D she said.
=20
ValueMax=E2=80=99s finance team includes a financial controller, group =
accountant and business analysts, with people from different age groups. =
Liew emphasises the need to hire young talents and train them, while =
also hiring people with experience in the pawnbroking industry.
=20
Beyond just hiring, she also seeks to empower the team by giving them a =
good working environment, which includes encouraging them to come up =
with new ideas for improvement and voicing their concerns.
=20
More acquisitions in a volatile world
=E2=80=9CWe will continue to look for opportunities to grow organically, =
as well as through acquisitions,=E2=80=9D she said.
=20
She notes that it is also important to keep track of their competitors. =
This ensures that ValueMax knows what its strengths are and how to grow =
accordingly. She acknowledges that it can be distracting to be =
overfocused on competitors, but emphasises the need to =E2=80=9Ctake =
surveys of the land=E2=80=9D.
=20
The group acquired Heng Heng Pawnshop and Ban Fook Pawnshop in March =
2025 as part of its expansion plans within Singapore.
=20
Liew added that ValueMax is =E2=80=9Cnot adverse=E2=80=9D to exploring =
complementary businesses. Without going into the specifics, she hinted =
that it is looking into micro-financing and scaling up its money-lending =
business.

[SINGAPORE] Property developer GuocoLand is selling the Thistle Johor =

The combined property has a net book value of RM93 million, with the =
land area at about 24,040 square metres. GuocoLand is thus expected to =
enjoy a net gain of about RM35 million upon completion of the sale.=20
=20
The Business Times understands that JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group =
brokered the deal.=20
=20
Thistle Johor Bahru is located within a 10-minute drive of the land =
border to Singapore, the world=E2=80=99s busiest land border crossing. =
It has 381 rooms featuring a mix of 347 rooms with city and sea views =
and 34 suites. It also has six food and beverage outlets, a two-level =
resort-style swimming pool, a spa, a fitness centre, tennis courts, as =
well as meeting and banqueting facilities.=20
=20
As at 9.07 am on Friday (Aug 29), shares of GuocoLand had declined 2.7 =

S$32.4 million.=20
GuocoLand falls by nearly 3% after reporting slump in H2 net profit to =

Cathay Cineplexes ceases operations as talks with creditors fall through
Parent company mm2 Asia will wind up the cinema chain, which is unable =
to continue as a going concern
=20
[SINGAPORE] Struggling cinema chain Cathay Cineplexes has ceased =
operations as of Monday (Sep 1), shortly after its voluntary liquidation =
was announced earlier in the day.=20
=20
The cinema chain, which owes money to landlords of several of its =
outlets, will undergo voluntary liquidation, said its parent company mm2 =
Asia : 1B0 0%. =20
=20
=E2=80=9CCathay Cineplexes had attempted to negotiate amicable =
resolutions with the various creditors, but (it) was unable to arrive at =
mutually agreeable restructuring outcomes of its payment obligations =
owed to these creditors,=E2=80=9D said the media company, which operates =
the cinema chain. =20
=20
In an Instagram post on Monday, the cinema chain said that it had =
=E2=80=9Cceased operations with immediate effect=E2=80=9D.=20
=20
Its website displayed no movie screenings as at Monday 11.48 am, =
although four cinema venues remained listed on the site. These are its =
Causeway Point, Downtown East, Century Square and Clementi outlets.=20
=20
Having considered the cinema chain=E2=80=99s financial position and the =
absence of restructuring outcomes, the board of Cathay Cineplexes has =
determined that it is =E2=80=9Cno longer feasible=E2=80=9D for it to =

=20
The board will proceed with a creditors=E2=80=99 voluntary liquidation =

=20
In recent months, Cathay Cineplexes received millions in payment demands =
from landlords of its outlets over rental arrears and other monies owed. =

=20
This came alongside a string of cinema outlet closures, with its Jem =
outlet shuttering in March and its West Mall outlet winding down in =
February.=20

In January, the cinema chain received payment demands for around S$2.7 =

ISOTeam's 2HFY2025 earnings below expectations but CGSI raises target =
price to 10.2 cents on growing project pipeline
=20
ISOTeam's 2HFY2025 numbers were below expectations and new order wins =
were slower too.
=20
Yet, Natalie Ong and Lim Siew Khee of CGS International have not only =
maintained their "add" call on the stock, they have also raised their =
target price from 9.6 cents to 10.2 cents, with a view that the =
company's recurring business model will put it in good stead to enjoy =
profit and margin recovery.
=20
For the half year ended June, ISOTeam, led by CEO Anthony Koh, reported =
earnings of $5.1 million, down 21% y-o-y, which Ong and Lim attribute to =
delays in revenue recognition which caused an "abnormally" weak half =
year.
=20
The company's order book as at June was $181 million, somewhat lower =
than $193 million recorded as at the end of the preceding year ended =
June 2024.
=20
Nonetheless, Ong and Lim believe that demand for the company's services =
will be well supported by a pipeline of some 100,000 new flats that will =
be launched between 2022 and 2027.
=20
In addition, there are various estate upgrading and enhancement =
contracts that ISOTeam will presumably bid for.
=20
Ong and Lim note that ISOTeam is moving into a new market segment: =
upgrading and renovating factory spaces that are being converted into =
workers' dormitories.
=20
On Aug 15, the company announced a collaboration with Design@Loft =
Architects to this end, where this partner will be responsible for the =
architectural design and regulatory submissions while ISOTeam will =
provide upgrading, renovation and construction works.
=20
ISOTeam is now in talks with 4 to 5 such potential clients, and the =
analysts think there could be more of such contracts given the shortage =
of worker accommodations in Singapore, as well as a 2030 deadline for =
all dorms to meet more stringent requirements.
=20
They continue to like this stock for its recurring business model and =
profit and margin recovery and are now applying a valuation multiple of =
8x FY2027 earnings, which is a discount of 16% off local listed peers =
because of its smaller scale, thereby deriving a target price of 10.2 =
cents.
=20
For them, key re-rating catalysts include stronger-than-forecast =
orderbook growth and potential commercialisation of its BuildTech =
solutions, which could add new asset leasing revenue and geographical =
diversification opportunities.
=20
On the other hand, delays in contract completion and constraints from =
cost and availability of foreign labour and subcontractors would be =
downside risks.\

Sing Investments & Finance, Advanced Holdings, Koyo Int=E2=80=99l =
=E2=80=98deeply undervalued opportunities=E2=80=99: Aletheia Capital
=20
Nirguan Tiruchelvam of Aletheia Capital has identified a handful of =
Singapore Exchange-listed stocks that he believes are =E2=80=9Cdeeply =
undervalued opportunities=E2=80=9D.
=20
To do so, he has applied three valuation metrics to assess balance sheet =
strength: net cash to market capitalisation, new working capital to =
market cap and net-net working capital to market cap.
=20
He writes in an Aug 28 note: =E2=80=9CWe identify Sing Investments & =
Finance (SIF), Advanced Holdings (ADV) and Koyo International as =
compelling opportunities among the deep-value players. ADV and Koyo =
International appear in at least two out of the three deep-value =
metrics. SIF could benefit from the rise of digital finance.=E2=80=9D
=20
Market cap to net cash
Tiruchelvam=E2=80=99s first rubric is to assess a company=E2=80=99s =
market cap to net cash. Should a company=E2=80=99s net cash exceed its =
market cap, Tiruchelvam writes that this implies investors are =
=E2=80=9Ceffectively paying nothing=E2=80=9D, or even receiving a =
discount for the core business.
=20
He writes: =E2=80=9CA stock trading below its net cash value is similar =
to buying cash at a discount. The rest of the business is thrown in for =
free. This offers an exceptional margin of safety.=E2=80=9D
=20
An example that =E2=80=9Cstands out sharply=E2=80=9D among small-caps is =
SIF, due to what Tiruchelvam calls its =E2=80=9Cextraordinary=E2=80=9D =
balance sheet strength.
=20
The company, with its net cash of around $2.9 billion against a market =
cap of around $286 million as at Aug 28, implies a market cap to net =
cash of just 0.1 times versus peers=E2=80=99 0.5 to 0.9 times.
=20
He adds: =E2=80=9CThis means investors are effectively paying only a =
fraction of its cash holdings, with the operating business valued at =
near-zero by the market. Relative to other cash-rich peers trading =
closer to 0.5 to 0.9 times, SIF=E2=80=99s valuation gap highlights a =
deep disconnect that could present a compelling re-rating =
opportunity.=E2=80=9D
=20
This possibility, Tiruchelvam notes, could come once the market begins =
to ascribe any value to SIF=E2=80=99s underlying business beyond cash.
=20
On the other hand, consumer health company Cordlife Group has a net cash =
ratio of 0.95 times, with its $58 million net cash almost equal to its =
market cap of $55 million.
=20
Tiruchelvam notes that Cordlife thus =E2=80=9Cranks near the =
top=E2=80=9D of peers like Trek 2000 and CFM Holdings, suggesting the =
market is valuing the business close to its cash pile.
=20
=E2=80=9CThis may signal undervaluation if operations are stable or =
improve. These companies are, by any classic definition, net cash =
bargains. If their businesses are wound down tomorrow, shareholders =
could plausibly recover more than the current share price,=E2=80=9D =
writes the analyst.
=20
Despite this, he adds that investors =E2=80=9Cshould be wary of =
traps=E2=80=9D, as certain deep cash discounts are a result of legacy =
issues. These include litigation, poor capital allocation or management =
entrenchment.
=20
Cordlife has been embroiled in a years-long scandal over its mishandling =
of cord blood units, forcing the Mainboard-listed company to pay out =
refunds to its customers.
=20
Tiruchelvam notes that it is therefore =E2=80=9Cessential to go beyond =
the numbers=E2=80=9D and assess the quality of cash, management =
intentions and potential catalysts.
=20
Market cap to net working capital
Tiruchelvam=E2=80=99s second valuation method is to determine whether a =
company=E2=80=99s net working capital, which includes receivables and =
inventories, exceeds its market capitalisation.
=20
=E2=80=9CThis suggests that even in the event of liquidation, the =
shareholders could recover well above current prices from short-term =
assets alone,=E2=80=9D he writes.
=20
He sees that several listed small- to mid-caps trade at market cap to =
net working capital ratios of 0.63 to 0.91 times, implying strong =
balance sheet support and meaningful downside protection. These include =
Baker Technology, Cordlife Group, Gallant Venture, Koyo International, =
Sing Holdings and AP Oil International.
=20
Although Tiruchelvam notes that these firms would deliver value even if =
liquidated at book value, thus offering investors both safety and upside =
optionality, =E2=80=9Ccaution is warranted=E2=80=9D.
=20
Excessive inventories or weak receivables, he adds, could reduce the =
quality of net working capital and limit actual cash conversion.
=20
Market capitalisation to net-net
The analyst=E2=80=99s third metric, market capitalisation to net-net, is =
=E2=80=9Cone of the strictest measures=E2=80=9D of value, which entails =
current assets minus total liabilities.
=20
Tiruchelvam notes that this method assumes fixed assets and intangibles =
are worthless and focuses only on current assets net of all liabilities.
=20
He writes: =E2=80=9CCompanies trading at or below this level are =
considered deeply undervalued. There are potential liquidation gains =
even in worst-case scenarios.=E2=80=9D
=20
In this space, he once again identifies Sing Holdings, AP Oil =
International and Koyo International, as a large share of their market =
caps is backed by liquid assets after liabilities. This offers strong =
balance sheet resilience and margin of safety.
=20
Tiruchelvam writes: =E2=80=9CThese elevated ratios suggest ample =
liquidity and a strong margin of safety. It positions itself for =
potential re-rating as markets begin valuing underlying business =
fundamentals beyond liquid assets.=E2=80=9D
=20
=E2=80=9CBy contrast, firms with ratios above 1.0 trade below their =
net-net value may carry hidden risks from long-term =
liabilities,=E2=80=9D he adds.
=20
Other ways of realising value
Beyond pure metrics, Tiruchelvam also sees that recognising stocks for =
their =E2=80=9Cintrinsic worth=E2=80=9D could come about from a =
=E2=80=9Ccontrarian or asymmetrical approach=E2=80=9D by investors. This =
could include factors such as a company=E2=80=99s corporate actions, =
sector recoveries and balance sheet monetisation.
=20
One of the most consistent avenues for unlocking value has been through =
corporate actions, he adds.
=20
Privatisations are a recurring feature of the Singapore market, =
particularly among family-controlled or state-linked firms, says =
Tiruchelvam.
=20
He cites the privatisation of shipping and logistics provider Goodpack =
by the US-listed private equity firm KKR & Co in 2014 at an enterprise =
value (EV) to earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and =
amortisation (ebitda) ratio of about 12 times an example of =
=E2=80=9Ccrystallising value for shareholders=E2=80=9D who had =
=E2=80=9Cendured years=E2=80=9D of undervaluation.
=20
=E2=80=9CSimilarly, Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) underwent a =
high-profile restructuring in 2021, spinning off its media assets before =
being taken private by the Cuscaden Peak consortium,=E2=80=9D adds =
Tiruchelvam.
=20
The unlocking of assets can also act as a catalyst. He notes that =
Boustead Singapore, which has historically traded at a =
=E2=80=9Csteep=E2=80=9D discount to its net asset value (NAV), =
successfully spun off Boustead Projects in 2015, thus =E2=80=9Callowing =
the market to assign a clearer valuation=E2=80=9D to its industrial real =
estate portfolio.
=20
He adds: =E2=80=9CShareholder returns can also be boosted through =
buybacks and special dividends, as demonstrated by UOL Group, which =
bought back stock in 2020 when it was trading at approximately 0.6 times =
book value, helping to narrow the discount.=E2=80=9D
=20
Recoveries
Another way to value realisation arises can come from sectoral =
recoveries and cyclical upturns.
=20
=E2=80=9CDepressed cyclicals on SGX have often rerated sharply when =
industry conditions improved. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding illustrates this =
dynamic. The company traded at less than five times earnings in 2019 to =
2020, only to more than double in value as the global shipbuilding cycle =
turned upwards,=E2=80=9D writes Tiruchelvam.
=20
Another example is Keppel Corporation, =E2=80=9Clong burdened=E2=80=9D =
by its exposure to the offshore and marine sector, has since benefited =
from restructuring efforts and the rebound in oil services.
=20
Policy tailwinds can provide an additional catalyst, with the analyst =
citing public works contractors OKP Holdings with its order book =
expansion and share price support during the 2016 to 2019 surge in =
infrastructure spending by the Land Transport Authority as a =
beneficiary.
=20
Of course, the strength of a company=E2=80=99s balance sheet is another =
=E2=80=9Cvital lever=E2=80=9D for value unlocking, with Tiruchelvam =
noting that many deep value companies on SGX possess =E2=80=9Chidden =
asset bases=E2=80=9D that are not adequately reflected in market =
valuations.
=20
According to him, real estate player Ho Bee Land is one such company, =
trading at around 0.4 times book value. The company owns a high-quality =
portfolio of London office assets that =E2=80=9Ccould be =
monetised=E2=80=9D to close the gap with NAV, he adds.
=20
Tiruchelvam writes: =E2=80=9CHwa Hong Corporation followed a similar =
trajectory. It was long neglected by the market despite trading at a =
steep discount to its assets. It was eventually privatised in 2022 at a =
premium.=E2=80=9D
=20
At the same time, companies with large net cash balances also offer =
downside protection while providing optionality for future growth or =
capital return. Technology players Frencken Group and Valuetronics fit =
this profile, as both traded close to or below net cash levels during =
the Covid-19 downturn, offering investors =E2=80=9Casymmetric =
upside=E2=80=9D as operations normalised.
=20
Improved governance and market recognition have also served as catalysts =
for certain stocks.
=20
Enhancements in corporate disclosure, transparency and alignment with =
minority shareholders can lead to increased institutional interest, =
notes Tiruchelvam.
=20
He writes: =E2=80=9CYangzijiang Financial=E2=80=99s spin-off in 2022, =
which separated its investment management arm from its core shipbuilding =
operations, exemplifies how structural changes can strengthen governance =
and unlock value.=E2=80=9D
=20
Finally, index inclusion provides another avenue for re-rating, with the =
analyst noting that Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) enjoyed =
greater liquidity and valuation support following its entry into the =
FTSE Straits Times All-Share Index, a market capitalisation weighted =
index that tracks the performance of companies listed on SGX that are =
within the top 98% by market capitalisation.

system of around 86 megawatt-peak (MWp) on the reservoir, the company =
said on Monday (Sep 1).=20
=20
Jen Tan, chief executive officer of Sembcorp Solar Singapore, pointed =
out that floating solar projects are =E2=80=9Cvital for =
Singapore=E2=80=99s land-scarce energy landscape=E2=80=9D.=20
=20
As Sembcorp=E2=80=99s third floating solar project in Singapore, the =
company said that this reinforces its position as a leading floating =
solar energy player in the country.=20
=20
In 2021, Sembcorp completed Singapore=E2=80=99s first large-scale inland =
floating solar farm at Tengeh Reservoir. The 60 MWp project was one of =
the largest single floating solar PV systems in the world at the time of =
its completion, said Sembcorp.=20
=20
Earlier in 2025, Sembcorp signed a 25-year renewable energy purchase =
agreement with Meta Platforms subsidiary Malkoha to build, own and =
operate a 150 MWp floating solar farm on Kranji Reservoir.=20
=20
Are sell-offs at Sembcorp, ST Engineering and SIA after their earnings =
reports a harbinger of doom?
Currently, Sembcorp has more than 1 gigawatt-peak of solar capacity and =
over 300 megawatt-hour of energy storage in its Singapore portfolio.=20
=20
Globally, the company=E2=80=99s renewable energy capacity stands at 18.9 =
gigawatts.

ComfortDelGro buys rest of CityCab shares for S$116.3 million from ST =
Engineering unit
The sale shares were valued at S$98.9 million
=20
[SINGAPORE] Transport giant ComfortDelGro : C52 +1.38% (CDG) acquired on =
Monday (Sep 1) all of ST Engineering Land Systems=E2=80=99 shares in =
taxi operator CityCab for a total purchase consideration of S$116.3 =
million.=20
=20
CityCab was a joint venture between CDG, which owned 53.5 per cent, and =
the ST Engineering : S63 -0.91% unit, which held the remaining 46.5 per =
cent stake.=20
=20
CityCab has been managed by CDG since 2005 as part of the =
latter=E2=80=99s local taxi business. It is now a wholly owned =
subsidiary of the mainboard-listed company.
=20
In a bourse filing, CDG said: =E2=80=9CFull ownership will strengthen =
the group=E2=80=99s core point-to-point business in Singapore and allow =
the group to better integrate and shape its global point-to-point =
business, adapting to market demands and boosting profit =
contribution.=E2=80=9D
=20
It expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive.
=20
Based on a jointly commissioned Aug 25 report by Deloitte & Touche =
Financial Advisory Services, both parties agreed on a valuation of =
S$98.9 million for the sale shares as at Jun 1, before arriving at the =
final S$116.3 million figure =E2=80=93 which has been paid in full and =
was funded through CDG=E2=80=99s bank facilities.
=20
CDG noted that the net tangible asset and book value attributable to ST =
Engineering Land Systems=E2=80=99 shares in CityCab is around S$37.4 =
million, based on the taxi operator=E2=80=99s audited financial =
statements for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2024.
=20
It added that the acquisition is not expected to have any material =
impact on its net tangible assets or earnings per share for its =
financial year ending Dec 31, 2025.
=20
For ST Engineering, the divestment will result in cash proceeds of =
S$116.3 million and translates to an enterprise value or earnings before =
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) multiple of 5.5 =
times based on CityCab=E2=80=99s unaudited Ebitda in the last 12 months =
for the period ended May 31, it said.
=20
The net tangible asset value and the book value attributable to its sale =
shares was around S$36 million, added ST Engineering.=20
=20
The group expects the divestment to result in a one-off gain on disposal =
of about S$77.2 million for the current financial year.=20
=20
ST Engineering added that its share of CityCab=E2=80=99s net profit for =
2024 stood at S$8.7 million, and that the taxi operator=E2=80=99s =
revenue was not consolidated into its financials since CityCab was =
equity accounted.=20
=20
The company noted that it will use the proceeds of the sale to pay down =
its debt, which will result in interest expense savings of some S$4 =
million on an annualised basis.
=20
CityCab began in 1995 with the merger of the taxi operations of the =
former Singapore Bus Service and Singapore Technologies Automotive, =
which in 1997 merged into ST Engineering.=20

=20
[SINGAPORE] Home-grown semiconductor optics startup MetaOptics intends =
to raise some S$6 million in gross proceeds from its initial public =
offering (IPO), as it issues 30 million placement shares at S$0.20 =
apiece.=20
=20
The company said on Monday (Sep 1) that trading of its shares is =
expected to begin on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange on Sep =
9. The placement will bring the company=E2=80=99s outstanding shares to =
more than 235 million in number, translating to a market capitalisation =
of about S$47.2 million.
=20
The vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of meta optics =
components and products on Monday registered its offer document for the =
proposed placement and listing of its ordinary shares.=20
=20
Zico Capital is the sponsor, issue manager and placement agent for the =
IPO.
=20
MetaOptics said it is the first pure-play meta-lens company to seek a =
public listing.=20
=20
The company, established in 2021, added that the net proceeds it is =
seeking to raise from the placement will amount to some S$4 million =
after deducting related commissions and estimated expenses.
=20
It intends to use the proceeds primarily for product development, =
research and development (R&D), as well as strategic partnerships. In =
addition, the money will be used for business expansion, through =
=E2=80=9Corganic growth, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and/or =
strategic partnerships=E2=80=9D.
=20
The funds will also go towards working capital and general corporate =
purposes, said the company.
=20
On its business strategies and future plans, MetaOptics said it intends =
to drive growth by focusing on miniaturising devices and integrating =
meta-lenses into a wider range of applications for smart devices, =
optical sensors, smart glasses, autonomous vehicles, as well as =
augmented or virtual reality displays.=20
=20
The company will introduce a new laser with a =E2=80=9Cpulsing feature =
to enable faster, customised mould production=E2=80=9D.=20

It added that its R&D efforts will target the =E2=80=9Cdevelopment of =
tuneable meta-lenses and strategic collaborations with customers and =
overseas innovation hubs=E2=80=9D.=20
=20
Said MetaOptics=E2=80=99 executive chairman and chief executive, Mark =
Thng: =E2=80=9CWith secured purchase orders and increasing design wins, =
we believe we are well placed to capture the rapidly expanding market in =
smart devices, IoT (internet of things), and next-generation optical =
systems.=E2=80=9D
=20
=E2=80=9CLooking ahead, supported by favourable industry prospects, our =
trusted partners in the ecosystem as well as our proven capabilities, we =
are confident that MetaOptics will continue to lead in innovative, =
high-performance optical solutions for next-generation applications, =
capable of delivering sustainable growth and long-term value to our =
shareholders.=E2=80=9D
=20
MetaOptics is headquartered in Singapore, at the JTC LaunchPad.=20
=20
The company on Jul 30 lodged its preliminary prospectus for the Catalist =
listing.
=20
The Business Times earlier reported that the company posted a net loss =
of S$2.3 million on a revenue of S$79,440 for FY2024. This followed net =
losses of S$1.2 million for FY2023, and S$1.1 million for FY2022.=20
=20
For the first quarter of 2025, its net loss was S$706,391.=20

Back in May, MetaOptics was one of three companies to bag top honours at =
BT=E2=80=99s inaugural Design AI and Tech Awards, a competition that =
aims to spur innovators to harness design and technology to develop =
groundbreaking solutions that tackle real-life business challenges.

Milestones in annual reporting: Beyond yesterday=E2=80=99s numbers, =

AI will change how such reports are created and consumed
=20
MILESTONES are not simply markers of time. They are moments that invite =
reflection, to pause and acknowledge achievements with gratitude, and to =
look ahead with renewed perspective and determination.
=20
This year, Singapore celebrates its 60th anniversary, a remarkable =
testament to six decades of resilience, unity and transformation. The =
Singapore Corporate Awards (SCA) marks its 20th anniversary, cementing =
its place as the stage on which excellence in corporate governance and =
reporting is recognised. Coincidentally, my own home institution, the =
NUS Business School, turns 60 this year as well.
=20
For those of us reflecting on the evolution of business and governance =
in Singapore, 2025 is nothing short of a milestone year.
=20
Since its inception, the SCA, organised by the Institute of Singapore =
Chartered Accountants (Isca), the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) =
and The Business Times, has been synonymous with raising standards of =
corporate governance practices in Singapore.
=20
Within this constellation of awards, the Best Annual Report Award (ARA) =
has stood as a beacon of exemplary corporate reporting. At this =
juncture, as the SCA turns 20, it feels fitting to reflect on how far =
annual reporting has come, and how the ARA has evolved over the years.
=20
Two decades ago, annual reports were quite different creatures. The =
emphasis was mostly on ensuring compliance with statutory requirements.
=20
The ARA rewarded companies that produced complete, high-quality and =
well-presented financial disclosures. Sustainability elements were =
minimal, and often relegated to side notes. Annual reports were largely =
static documents, designed to meet the letter of the rules rather than =
to tell the fuller story of the company.
=20
Over time, the focus of annual reporting shifted profoundly as =
expectations of investors and stakeholders began to change.
=20
Annual reports became a window into the company: its mission, =
strategies, risks and, increasingly, its impact on society and the =
environment. Compliance gradually gave way to communication.
=20
Strategic storytelling
The best annual reports today are strategic storytelling tools that =
weave together a company=E2=80=99s purpose, performance and prospects =
into a coherent whole. Sustainability reporting moved from the margins =
to the mainstream, and ESG disclosures are no longer optional extras, =
but core measures of corporate responsibility and long-term value =
creation.
=20
The ARA has been a mirror to this transformation. From recognising those =
who excelled at clear financial disclosures, it now rewards those who =
tell a compelling, integrated story. Impact and accountability have =
become the heart of great reporting.
=20
The winners of the 2025 ARA embody this shift, and exemplify the very =
best of what corporate reporting can achieve.
=20
In the big-cap category (market capitalisation of S$1 billion and =
above), DBS Group Holdings clinched the Gold, with Singapore =
Telecommunications (Singtel) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation =
(OCBC) claiming the Silver and Bronze. The winners are distinguished by =
their integration of corporate mission, risk assessment, financial =
performance and ESG strategy into a seamless narrative that not only =
informed, but also inspired in equal measure.
=20
In the mid-cap category (market capitalisation of $300 million to $1 =
billion), SBS Transit drove home the point that operational detail and =
forward-looking insight can ride comfortably side by side. Its =
gold-winning report was clear, structured and highly readable. Far East =
Orchard (Silver award) and Hong Leong Asia (Bronze Award) followed with =
commendable efforts that kept pace with rising expectations.
=20
In the small-cap category (market capitalisation of under $300 million), =
Qian Hu shone with its informative and clear report. Close behind is =
Banyan Tree Holdings and Hotel Royal, the latter making its debut =
appearance with an innovative, comprehensive effort that earned it a =
place on the podium.
=20
Among Reits and Business Trusts, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust =
stood alone as the Gold winner, praised for its clear articulation of =
portfolio performance and substantive disclosures.
=20
While larger companies often have greater resources to produce more =
sophisticated reports, this year=E2=80=99s results show that excellence =
is not a matter of size. Mid- and smaller-cap winners demonstrated that =
clarity of thought, relevance of disclosures to stakeholders and =
innovative presentations can be just as impactful.
=20
Beyond financial figures
To lead the pack today, it is no longer enough to simply disclose more; =
rather, the disclosures must be meaningful, coherent and relevant. That =
includes minimising boilerplate language, using visuals to clarify =
rather than to decorate, and maintaining a consistent voice that =
reflects the company=E2=80=99s character and strategy.
=20
The common thread observed by the ARA judging panel among all the =
winners was their ability to provide information that investors find =
useful.
=20
Today, investors and stakeholders look well beyond the financial =
numbers. They seek context, perspective and insight into what drives =
performance. They want clarity on the market environment, the risks a =
company faces and the strategies it employs to navigate them effectively =
and responsibly.
=20
Forward-looking perspectives are valued as much as historical =
performance, and transparency is expected, not only in celebrating =
successes but also in acknowledging setbacks and challenges. For =
companies, meeting these expectations brings tangible benefits, from =
strengthening investor confidence to deepening stakeholder trust.
=20
But milestones are not only about looking back, they are also about =
charting the way forward.
=20
In his recent SG60 National Day message, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong =
reminded us that progress depends on drawing strength from the past =
while pressing forward with confidence.
=20
At these crossroads, the question naturally arises: where is annual =
reporting heading? Yet, perhaps the more critical question is not merely =
one of direction, but of aspiration. What should we, as a business =
community, envision annual reporting becoming?
=20
The answer is already beginning to take shape.
=20
ESG will and should remain at the forefront. The focus, however, is =
shifting from broad intentions to measurable impact.
=20
Investors and stakeholders increasingly expect quantified results tied =
directly to corporate strategy and financial performance. Global =
standards set by, for example, the International Sustainability =
Standards Board (ISSB) will help ensure comparability, while external =
assurance on sustainability data will likely become the norm rather than =
the exception, cementing credibility.
=20
Sustainability should not appear as a detached insert; it should be =
woven seamlessly into the fabric of the company=E2=80=99s story, so that =
readers are not left burdened with piecing together two separate =
reports.
=20
Static, text-heavy PDF reports will increasingly give way to =
digital-first formats that are more interactive, visual and engaging. =
Reports of the future will be living documents, rich with user-friendly =
visualisation and dashboards that enable stakeholders to explore trends =
and performance with greater ease and depth.
=20
The most compelling reports will be those that connect strategy, risk, =
financials and ESG into one coherent story that informs decisions.
=20
On to the next milestones
Looking ahead, artificial intelligence (AI) will almost certainly =
reshape how annual reports are created and consumed. As AI capabilities =
expand, so too will the demand for real-time reporting.
=20
For companies, AI tools can streamline production, detect =
inconsistencies, enhance data visualisation and generate timely updates. =
For readers, AI offers more dynamic and personalised experiences, so =
users can query the information in real time and receive tailored, =
evidence-based responses specific to their needs.
=20
These possibilities are exciting and will open new avenues of =
engagement, but they will also bring new responsibilities. Ensuring that =
AI-generated content remains accurate, authentic, and aligned with =
reporting standards will be critical.
=20
As Nelson Mandela once said: =E2=80=9CRemember to celebrate milestones =
as you prepare for the road ahead.=E2=80=9D
=20
Singapore=E2=80=99s 60 years of dynamic nation-building, the =
SCA=E2=80=99s 20 years of recognising excellence, and the ARA=E2=80=99s =
journey from past to present all remind us that progress is built on the =
foundations of yesterday, but sustained by the choices we make today for =
tomorrow. The challenge now is to keep evolving.
=20
Annual reports must continue to innovate, embrace technology with =
responsibility, and integrate financial and non-financial performance =
into a single compelling narrative. Above all, they must remain grounded =
in transparency, because trust is the currency on which long-term value =
is built.
=20
Milestones are not end points, but markers along the road. As we =
celebrate the ARA winners of 2025, we do so with the knowledge that the =
next chapter will demand even more.
=20
The future of annual reporting will belong to those who can combine the =
rigour of transparency and accuracy with the art of storytelling, who =
can harness technology while preserving the irreplaceable human touch, =
and who understand that excellence is not a destination, but a =
continuous journey.

Rents for privately held HDB shops double in past year; prices hold =
steady for those leased from HDB
The rising rents are squeezing some shops in the HDB heartland, leading =
them to relocate, downsize or close altogether
=20
[SINGAPORE] Rental rates have more than doubled for privately held HDB =
shop units, particularly over the past year, while rents for shops =
directly leased out by HDB have mostly held steady.
=20
Median rentals for heartland shops held by private landlords rose from =
$3.51 per sq ft (psf) in the second quarter of 2024 to S$7.34 psf in the =
second quarter of 2025.
=20
This is the highest ever rental rate for privately held HDB shops, =
according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority=E2=80=99s (URA) Realis =
data that dates back to 1999.=20
=20
Meanwhile, shops directly rented out by HDB have seen rents rise at a =
more gradual rate.
=20
HDB said rents for nine in 10 of such shops have remained largely =
unchanged over the past five years.
=20
Property analysts and agents attributed the rise in rental rates for =
privately held HDB shops to increased demand for such units after =
consumer sentiment improved post-pandemic, even though there are signs =
that this demand is now moderating.
=20
HDB shop units can either be rented from private owners or the state. =
The Housing Board said there are about 8,500 privately held HDB shops, =
while the remaining 7,000 shop units are directly rented out by the =
government.=20
=20
In 1998, the government stopped selling HDB shop units to private =
owners, and the board now rents them out directly.
=20
HDB said this gives it the =E2=80=9Cflexibility to better curate the =
trade mix of shops=E2=80=9D and respond to residents=E2=80=99 needs.=20
=20
The rising rents are squeezing some shops in the HDB heartland, leading =
them to relocate, downsize or close altogether.
=20
Coping with rising private rentals
To cope, some business owners have been subletting a part of their HDB =
shops.
=20
For instance, Ken Seng Guan=E2=80=99s bakery chain carved out a roughly =
250 sq ft space from its 600 sq ft Pek Kio outlet and has sublet it to =
various shops over the 10 years it has operated the space =E2=80=93 from =
a bubble tea store to a stationery shop, and now, a hair salon.
=20
The Bakery Cuisine director said his rent =E2=80=93 currently S$12,000 =
=E2=80=93 has gone up by about 40 per cent over the past decade, or =
about 10 per cent every three years.
=20
The roughly S$3,800 in monthly income from subletting has helped Bakery =
Cuisine continue running the privately held Pek Kio store despite rising =
overheads, said Ken.
=20
Ken=E2=80=99s business also sublets some of its HDB-owned shops in =
Punggol and Pasir Ris, where rentals have hovered around S$4,000 to =
S$5,000 over the 10 to 20 years he has run them.
=20
While rents for his HDB-owned stores have held steady, Ken said he =
continues renting from private landlords because these stores =E2=80=93 =
built before 1998 =E2=80=93 tend to be near town centres, where footfall =
is higher.
=20
There is no available data on how many tenants of privately held HDB =
shops sublet their units.
=20
About 4 per cent of the 7,000 shops rented out by HDB are subletting =
their units, the board said. This excludes about 500 coffee shops, =
markets and market-produce shops.
=20
Other businesses said they have had to downsize to smaller units.
=20
In March 2024, mobile phone retailer Erajaya moved from its 500 sq ft =
unit in the atrium area of HDB Hub in Toa Payoh to a smaller 300 sq ft =
unit in a nearby block, after its private landlord asked for a 20 per =
cent to 30 per cent increase in rent. The business was paying about =
S$28,000 a month.
=20
Jeff Ho, the store=E2=80=99s operations manager until early August, said =
the hike would have been unsustainable.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe are just getting by. Our margins are small given the high =
rental,=E2=80=9D said the 45-year-old.
=20
Commuters passing by Singtel mobile phone retailer Erajaya=E2=80=99s =
shop in a row of HDB retail units at the foot of Block 190 Lorong 6 Toa =
Payoh during the evening rush hour on Jun 19. PHOTO: MARK CHEONG, ST
He added that rent for its current shop at Block 190 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh =
is about 20 per cent lower, but the trade-off is having less room to =
display products and serve customers.
=20
Retailers in the same row of shops as Erajaya said at least five shops =
there have shuttered or downsized in the past year because of rental =
hikes and poor business.
=20
According to Realis data, median rents for privately held HDB shops in =
Toa Payoh rose by 58.6 per cent from S$4.91 psf in the fourth quarter of =
2024 to S$7.70 psf in the second quarter of 2025.
=20
Even though rents for privately held HDB shops may be more volatile, =
property agents told The Straits Times many businesses still opt to =
lease from private landlords as their shops are located in older estates =
built before 1998.
=20
Privately held HDB shops can also be rented out to any business, as long =
as they are on HDB=E2=80=99s list of allowable trades.
=20
In comparison, units rented out by HDB are bound to specific trades =
under the tenancy agreement =E2=80=93 for example, a unit that HDB has =
marked out for a medical facility cannot be rented out to a cafe owner.
=20
The supply of privately held HDB shops that the government stopped =
selling in 1998 is expected to become tighter because these units =
typically have 30-year leases, said Nicholas Mak, chief research officer =
at property search portal  =
<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=3D9ac683f1-fe6d2c51-9ac236c7-3cece=
feaf2ae-51a0fb5c89932bdc&q=3D1&e=3D1484d211-6cd4-420c-960c-be3e5e2f6097&u=
=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg.
=20
This means the lease for the last HDB sold shop with a 30-year lease =
could expire in 2028, he said.
=20
=E2=80=9CGoing forward, the government will be the main landlord of HDB =
shop units. Hence, it will be up to the government to manage the rental =
costs of tenants in state-owned HDB shop units,=E2=80=9D said Mak.
=20
HDB had in 2022 extended the leases for some 730 privately held HDB =
shops with expiring tenancies by at least a year. During the extension, =
they could make new business plans or bid for a new tenancy.
=20
Steady rents for those renting from HDB
Meanwhile, businesses that rent from the government said rents have held =
mostly steady.
=20
Data provided by HDB showed that the average rent for medical facilities =
rose to S$8.71 psf in 2024, up 13 per cent from S$7.68 psf in 2020.
=20
The average rent for food and beverage shops was S$7.66 psf in 2020, =
compared with S$8.12 psf in 2024, while those for essential services =
=E2=80=93 minimarts, provision shops and supermarkets =E2=80=93 went =
from S$5.15 psf in 2020 to S$5.36 psf in 2024.
=20
Unlike URA=E2=80=99s Realis, which gives rental data for privately held =
HDB shops in median values =E2=80=93 the middle point when rents are =
arranged from lowest to highest =E2=80=93 HDB provides rental data using =
average values. This is calculated by taking the mean of all the rents.
=20
Darren Tan, who runs bakery chain iCakes, said stable rental is a major =
perk of leasing a shop in Buangkok from HDB, for which he pays about =
S$5,000 a month in rent.
=20
The 35-year-old said rent for the roughly 500 sq ft unit had increased =
by about 10 per cent over the seven years he has operated it, which he =
said was reasonable for a mature estate.
=20
Mobile phone retailer Yeo Siew Ngee said rental for a 150 sq ft shop he =
leases from HDB in Toa Payoh has been more reasonable than what private =
landlords are charging him for another two shops of the same size in the =
area.
=20
He said HDB has increased the rent by about 5 to 10 per cent in the =
decade that he has operated the store, whereas private landlords have =
raised rentals by 20 to 30 per cent over the same period.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe rent increases for my HDB shop are minimal, and that has =
helped me to sustain the business. For my other two stores, I have to =
sublet a part of the space to make sure we can afford the rent,=E2=80=9D =
said Yeo, 51, who declined to give specific figures.
=20
But some business owners said HDB-owned shop units can be difficult to =
secure because of high bids.
=20
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician Tan Yuan Ming said he was =
edged out of a public tender for an HDB retail unit in Sengkang in March =
by bids that were twice his own.
=20
Tan made a bid of S$4,700 for the 527 sq ft unit, but saw that =
successive bids on HDB=E2=80=99s online bidding portal hit five-figure =
sums.
=20
The unit at Block 279 Sengkang East Avenue was awarded to Q & M Dental =
Centre, which had placed a S$14,000 bid. There were 21 bidders for the =
unit, who submitted bids ranging from S$3,850 to S$14,000.
=20
Tan, 32, has since 2023 been looking for a retail unit to grow his =
business The TCM Folks, a mobile TCM clinic he founded in 2022. It =
currently makes house calls as it does not have a brick-and-mortar =
space.
=20
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d thought it=E2=80=99d be cheaper to rent a shop from =
HDB, but it turned out that the bids still went way above what we can =
stomach as a small business,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
That said, property agents said there are signs that rents for HDB shops =
are cooling. They attributed this to an uncertain economic outlook, =
which has spooked businessmen from opening new stores.
=20
Business owners are also more cautious about committing to high rents, =
causing rental growth to moderate slightly in 2025, said ERA property =
agent Patrick Poh.
=20
With businesses also facing greater cost pressures =E2=80=93 from =
manpower to utilities =E2=80=93 landlords are also becoming slightly =
more flexible in rental negotiations, Poh added.
=20
Alex Wong from PropNex Realty said: =E2=80=9CIn 2024, it was more of a =
landlord=E2=80=99s market, when the sentiment among businesses was =
bullish.
=20
=E2=80=9CToday, it=E2=80=99s become more of a tenant=E2=80=99s market, =
as inquiries have dropped and landlords seem more willing to negotiate =
offers that do not meet their asking prices.=E2=80=9D=20
8PR ASIA
Marina Bay Sands=E2=80=99 scale, success and bold expansion are a =
blessing and a curse for Singapore=E2=80=99s hotel sector
The integrated resort is outperforming the industry and its expansion =
will augment its leading position
=20
[SINGAPORE] The picture for Singapore=E2=80=99s hotel sector in the =
second quarter was not pretty. However, the sector=E2=80=99s performance =
in July showed improvement from the year-ago period.=20
=20
In Q2 2025, the Republic=E2=80=99s hotels posted an average room rate =
(ARR) of S$263.83, down 1.1 per cent from the year-ago period=E2=80=99s =
S$266.89, according to Singapore Tourism Board (STB) data.
=20
Average occupancy rate for hotels here slipped from 78.2 per cent in Q2 =
2024 to 77.8 per cent in the second quarter. As such, revenue per =
available room (RevPAR) fell 1.7 per cent to S$205.15 in Q2 2025, from =
S$208.77 in Q2 2024.
=20
On the supply front, there were 5.9 million available room nights in Q2 =
2025, up 2.4 per cent from the year-ago quarter.
=20
Meanwhile, on the demand side, observers noted that the =
US-tariff-related uncertainty may have led to delayed or cancelled =
travel plans and muted the willingness of business and leisure =
travellers to spend. Furthermore, the strong Singapore dollar did not =
help.
=20
Unsurprisingly, listed trusts which are major owners of hotels here, =
such as CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 +1.89% and Far East Hospitality =
Trust, : Q5T +0.85% posted weaker financial performance =E2=80=93 both =
trusts declared substantially lower distribution per stapled security =
for H1 2025 compared with H1 2024.
=20
However, STB=E2=80=99s data showed ARR, average occupancy rate and =
RevPAR of Singapore=E2=80=99s hotels rose year on year (yoy) in July =
2025, with RevPAR at S$250.78, up 3.8 per cent yoy.=20
=20
MBS=E2=80=99 performance
Nonetheless, even as the hotel sector faces uncertainties, integrated =
resort Marina Bay Sands (MBS), which fronts Marina Bay, is powering =
ahead.
=20
For the quarter ended June, MBS=E2=80=99 owner New York-listed Las Vegas =
Sands (LVS) reported that MBS=E2=80=99 ARR for Q2 2025 grew to US$888 =
from US$797 in Q2 2024, up 11.4 per cent yoy.=20
=20
In Q2 2025, MBS=E2=80=99 occupancy was 95 per cent, versus 95.3 per cent =
in the year-ago quarter.=20
=20
Thus, MBS=E2=80=99 second quarter RevPAR climbed 11.2 per cent yoy to =
US$844. =20
=20
MBS is outperforming the luxury tier of Singapore hotels. According to =
STB data, for the months of April to June, the ARR of the luxury tier of =
hotels ranged from S$630.64 to S$648.11 while occupancy rate was between =
76.25 per cent and 78.99 per cent. =20
=20
Perhaps, MBS=E2=80=99 strong performance is due to its scale and unique =
offering.
=20
Today, MBS has 775 suites and 1,069 rooms. In each of the last four =
years, MBS employed over 10,000 full-time employees.
=20
The integrated resort=E2=80=99s retail offering =E2=80=93 The Shoppes at =
MBS =E2=80=93 has a sizeable 620,513 sq ft of gross lettable area and =
hosts numerous flagship stores of major brands.=20
=20
MBS is central to the meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions =
(Mice) business in Singapore. There are over 300,000 sq ft of exhibition =
halls at Sands Convention and Exhibition Centre. Also, MBS has 21 =
ballrooms of varying sizes, including the largest, the Sands Grand =
Ballroom, which can accommodate up to 8,000 guests.
=20
Add to all of the above, centrally located MBS boasts great dining =
spots, the Republic=E2=80=99s largest nightclub Marquee, a casino, a =
skypark with the world=E2=80=99s longest infinity pool, an ArtScience =
Museum and iconic architecture.
=20
MBS shines not just in Singapore=E2=80=99s tourism scene but also =
relative to LVS=E2=80=99 Macau operations. According to  its latest =
earnings presentation, LVS has five integrated resorts with about 10,800 =
rooms and suites in Macau.
=20
For Q2 2025, LVS reported that MBS=E2=80=99 adjusted property earnings =
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) was US$768 =
million while that of Macau operations was US$566 million. Adjusted =
property Ebitda margin of MBS was 55.3 per cent versus 31.5 per cent for =
Macau operations. =20
=20
MBS=E2=80=99 expansion
Given MBS=E2=80=99 success, LVS can confidently embark on major =
expansion plans for MBS, despite geopolitical tensions and US=E2=80=99 =
trade tariffs affecting the economic growth outlook globally and in =
Singapore.
=20
In May, piling and foundation work commenced on MBS=E2=80=99 US$8 =
billion expansion project, with construction estimated to be completed =
in mid-2030.=20
=20
The project will introduce a new 570-suite hotel, a 15,000-seat arena, =
additional Mice capacity and entertainment offerings including premium =
gaming areas.
=20
Certainly, MBS has contributed enormously to Singapore=E2=80=99s =
economic growth and her appeal as an exciting global city.
=20
MBS has created many jobs as well as sourcing and procurement =
opportunities for Singapore-based small and medium enterprises.=20
=20
The integrated resort=E2=80=99s expansion project can help to =
substantially strengthen the city-state=E2=80=99s appeal to luxury =
travellers, as a key Mice destination and as a leading venue for global =
entertainment events among others.
=20
For sure, MBS=E2=80=99 success has generated some tailwinds for =
Singapore=E2=80=99s hospitality sector. And MBS=E2=80=99 expansion =
project could further benefit other hotels here. =20
=20
Think of how MBS draws more leisure visitors here, with many of these =
visitors visiting the integrated resort but staying elsewhere in the =
city-state. Or how MBS hosts Mice events that attract international =
visitors who stay at accommodation islandwide.
=20
Imagine too how the new 15,000-seat arena could host top live musical =
performances which draw visitors from the region, thus driving demand =
for the entire hotel sector here.=20
=20
However, MBS is grabbing significant market share, be it in the high-end =
hotel, luxury retail, premier dining or nightlife segments, which can =
hurt other owners of properties targeting these segments.
=20
For example, sought-after luxury leisure travellers to Singapore might =
choose to stay at MBS despite MBS=E2=80=99 room rates being higher than =
numerous top-tier hotels because of its unique offerings and resist =
swapping staying at the integrated resort for what may be inferior =
substitutes.
=20
With MBS being big and successful, and growing even bigger, expect it to =
hog talent in the Republic=E2=80=99s hospitality industry, which faces =
manpower challenges as many locals may shun working in an industry where =
hours can be long and working nights and on weekends could be required.  =
 =20
=20
Given its scale, MBS is well-placed to offer employees better perks, =
training and career development opportunities relative to other smaller =
hotels here. Indeed, the integrated resort is widely recognised as an =
employer of choice.
=20
Ultimately, Singapore gains from MBS flourishing and growing. However, =
while this giant brings some business to the wider hotel sector here, it =
also makes the going much tougher for other top-tier hotels in =
attracting demand for rooms, dining outlets and events.  =20

Guangzhou Knowledge City a useful test bed for developing new =
technologies: DPM Gan, Guangdong governor
The deputy prime minister is also visiting Shenzhen and Beijing during =
his five-day trip
=20
[SINGAPORE] The China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City (CSGKC) is a =
useful test bed for the development of new technologies and will =
continue to support knowledge-sharing, leaders of the two regions said =
on Monday (Sep 1).
=20
Singapore=E2=80=99s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said this in a =
statement after Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Gan Kim Yong visited the =
CSGKC, a state-level bilateral project that marks its 15th anniversary =
this year. While in Guangzhou, he met Guangdong Governor Wang Weizhong, =
who also hosted him to lunch.
=20
DPM Gan=E2=80=99s trip to the 232 square kilometre township was the =
first stop in his five-day working visit to China that began on Sunday.
=20
On Monday, he visited the National University of Singapore Guangzhou =
Research Translation and Innovation Institute, the DBS Global Fintech =
R&D Centre, and agritech startup Singrow.
=20
These are among the more than 50 Singapore companies currently based in =
CSGKC, which has served as a key landing pad for them to access the =
Greater Bay Area.
In its statement, MFA said that DPM Gan and Wang reaffirmed the strong =
economic collaboration and longstanding people-to-people ties between =
Singapore and Guangdong.
=20
Guangdong has been Singapore=E2=80=99s top provincial trading partner in =
China for the last 36 consecutive years, noted MFA. =E2=80=9CBeyond =
trade, our robust cooperation has expanded to a wide range of sectors, =
including advanced manufacturing, digital economy, intellectual property =
rights protection, education and healthcare,=E2=80=9D the ministry =
added.
=20
Apart from Guangzhou, DPM Gan is also visiting Shenzhen and Beijing. On =
Wednesday, he will attend a series of commemorative events marking the =
80th anniversary of the end of World War II.
=20
This is his first visit to China since becoming DPM. His trip comes =
about two months after Prime Minister Lawrence Wong made his first =
official visit to Beijing and Tianjin, at the invitation of Chinese =
Premier Li Qiang.

Time is running out for Singapore=E2=80=99s oldest HDB flats as prices =
flatten and demand slows=20
As demand dwindles for older HDB flats, questions remain over how a =
voluntary redevelopment scheme will change the market
=20
[SINGAPORE] Nearly 300 blocks of Singapore=E2=80=99s oldest Housing & =
Development Board (HDB) flats are entering the final 30-year stretch of =
their 99-year leases =E2=80=93 and data points to a shrinking resale =
market and flattening prices for these ageing properties.
=20
Asking prices and resale values for the first HDB flats built in the =
1960s have held up as the resale market on the whole continued to rise, =
especially over the last five years. But set against the broader market =
and compared to valuations, the picture is less rosy.  =20
=20
Data crunched by property listing platform PropertyGuru for The Business =
Times indicates that median asking prices of HDB flats built in the =
1960s held steady in the past year, up 1.6 per cent to S$375,000.=20
=20
ERA key executive officer Eugene Lim said many of these old flats in =
sought-after mature estates witnessed substantial price growth in the =
last five years despite their age, in tandem with the overall resale =
market.=20
=20
In the first seven months of 2025, the median price of three-room flats =
built in the 1960s ranged from S$335,000 to S$380,000 =E2=80=93 up by =
between 30 per cent and 60 per cent compared to their median in 2020 at =
between S$220,000 and S$275,000. That of two-room flats likewise rose =
from S$188,000-S$207,000 in 2020, to S$285,000-S$301,888 in 2025.=20
=20
Old four-room flats in Queenstown even hit a median price of S$899,000 =
in 2025, though Lim noted that the transactions were for terraced =
houses, which are rare and tend to draw high prices.=20
=20
Set against a longer time frame, gains shrink. Huttons Asia senior =
director of data analytics Lee Sze Teck pointed out that compared to =
2013, prices of the oldest two-room and three-room flats are 5.8 to 5.9 =
per cent higher today. =20
=20
In comparison, prices of two-room flats built in the 1970s rose by 15.5 =
per cent between 2013 and 2025, and that of three-room flats by 12.4 per =
cent.=20
=20
Lee Nai Jia, PropertyGuru head of real estate intelligence, data and =
software solutions, noted that the 1.6 per cent rise in asking prices =
for the 60s era flats is modest compared to the 10.3 per cent increase =
observed in the broader resale market.=20
=20

=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg showed that the median asking =
price of 1960s HDB flats ranged from S$309,000 to S$1.75 million this =
year, with the lowest for two-room flats and the highest for terraced =
houses. The median asking price of three-room flats, which comprised the =
bulk of listings on the portal, was S$388,888.=20
=20
Meanwhile, median valuations ranged between S$316,000 and S$847,000 for =
these flats.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CThis suggests that two-room flats may be underpriced on the =
market, whereas five-room flats and terraced houses appear to be =
overpriced,=E2=80=9D said Mak. Three-room flats, in particular, had a =
median valuation of S$336,000, which was far below their median asking =
price of S$388,888.=20
=20
Lee from PropertyGuru said demand for 60s era flats has been trending =
downwards.=20
=20
According to the platform=E2=80=99s data, impressions =E2=80=93 or views =
=E2=80=93 on resale listings for the oldest flats fell about 28 per cent =
year on year, a sharp drop compared to the overall resale market. =20
=20
As the government ramps up new public housing supply, Lee reckoned that =
demand for these older flats will only continue to dwindle, potentially =
placing downward pressure on prices.=20
=20
ERA=E2=80=99s Lim noted that transaction activity for these older flats =
has remained fairly stable in the past decade, ranging from 219 to 300 =
units a year. On average, 263 homes built in the 1960s change hands =
annually.=20
=20
In the first seven months of 2025, 170 units were sold =E2=80=93 =
tracking within historical norms.=20
=20
Fewer transactions does not necessarily reflect weaker demand, and could =
be due to a limited supply of flats for sale, said Lim.=20
=20
On the rental front, Lee from PropertyGuru said listing impressions =
generally tracked the overall HDB rental trend.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CWhile rental demand saw a decline from 2023 to 2024, it appears =
to have stabilised in 2025,=E2=80=9D said Lee. Listings were typically =
room rentals, with average asking rent of around S$1,100 per month as at =
July 2025.=20
=20
Cashing out
=20
Seniors seeking more immediate ways to monetise their homes can turn to =
HDB=E2=80=99s lease buyback scheme (LBS).=20
=20
Under the scheme, eligible seniors can sell part of their flat=E2=80=99s =
remaining lease to HDB, with proceeds topping up their CPF Retirement =
Account and purchasing a CPF Life plan, which provides monthly payouts =
for life. Any excess will be returned to them in cash,=20
=20
As at Dec 31, 2024, 13,734 households have taken up LBS. Of these, about =
52 per cent lived in three-room or smaller flats, around 34 per cent =
lived in four-room flats, and the remaining 14 per cent in five-room or =
bigger flats.=20
=20
The vast majority of households at 90 per cent retain lease lengths of =
20 to 30 years, said HDB, allowing seniors to =E2=80=9Csupplement their =
retirement income while ageing=E2=80=9D. The remaining households were =
evenly split between 15-year and 35-year leases.
=20
HDB added that after selling part of their remaining leases to HDB, =
around nine in 10 households received proceeds of between S$100,000 and =
S$300,000.=20
=20
This value is before the top-up to their CPF retirement account, and =
depends on the market value of the flats and duration of the lease =
retained, it said.=20
=20
Seniors can also receive a cash bonus when they right-size to a smaller =
public housing flat with the silver housing bonus. As at Dec 2024, 2,535 =
households have benefitted from the bonus.=20
=20
Ageing flats, shrinking value
Figures from ERA indicated that there are 299 HDB blocks built in the =
1960s, with 24,428 units in total. Most are concentrated in Queenstown, =
Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah and Geylang, with smaller clusters in Kallang =
Whampoa and the Central area.=20
=20
One of the government=E2=80=99s objectives when it launched the public =
housing programme in the 1960s was to ease overcrowding in the city =
centre by providing affordable flats in the city fringe area, Mak said.=20
=20
Most of these 60s-era flats are three-room and four-room flats, =
statistics from  =
<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=3Df7dc303f-93779f9f-f7d88509-3cece=

=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fmogul.sg%2F> Mogul.sg showed.=20
=20
Analysts expect these ageing flats to follow the trajectory observed in =
older private leasehold homes.=20
=20
According to Huttons=E2=80=99 Lee, prices of 60-year leasehold terraced =
houses at Lorong 3 Geylang tapered off sharply as their leases came to =
an end.=20
=20
In 2013, units transacted for over S$200,000. This fell to just over =
S$150,000 in 2014, equivalent to annual rent of S$33,000; declining =
further to over S$100,000 in 2015, equivalent to annual rent of =
S$30,000; before dropping to around S$50,000 in 2017 and 2018, =
equivalent to annual rent of S$25,000.=20
=20
The land occupied by these houses returned to the state when their =
leases expired on Dec 31, 2020.=20
=20
Singapore attempted to address issues related to rebuilding ageing =
housing estates with the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (Sers), =
launched in 1995.=20
=20
Under the compulsory scheme, old HDB blocks were demolished and rebuilt. =
Homeowners were compensated based on market value and given the option =
to buy a replacement flat nearby with a fresh 99-year lease.=20
=20
In 2022, households in Ang Mo Kio whose flats were picked for Sers =
received compensation of up to S$450,000. Those flats were completed in =
1979 and were about 43 years old then.
=20
On top of that, flat owners received a grant of S$30,000, a removal =
allowance of S$10,000, and payment of stamp and legal fees for the =
purchase of a replacement flat equivalent in value to their Sers flat.
=20
Mak said the =E2=80=9Cattractive terms=E2=80=9D led some buyers to pay =
=E2=80=9Ctop dollar=E2=80=9D for flats aged 40 years or more, in hopes =
of being picked for Sers.=20
=20
=E2=80=9C(It) cultivated the mindset among HDB resale flat buyers that =
Sers is some sort of safety net for owners of older flats,=E2=80=9D he =
said, =E2=80=9Ca kind of government bailout for owners of ageing =
flats=E2=80=9D. =20
=20
This fuelled price growth of these older flats, said Mak. =
=E2=80=9CHowever, Sers is an expensive exercise for the government, and =
with the growing number of ageing flats, it is unsustainable in the long =
run.=E2=80=9D=20
=20
Earlier in August, Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat said =
the government does not plan to continue Sers, but instead will focus on =
a voluntary early redevelopment scheme (Vers), first surfaced in 2018. =20

Older flat owners may not want to move or sell if it means having to get =

Prive group put up for sale more than a year before closure; no takers =
in tough market
The F&B group tried all options to stay in business to no avail, says =
group chairman Yuan Oeij
=20
THE Prive group, which suddenly announced the closure of all its =
restaurants on Monday (Sep 1), had been on the market for over a year =
but failed to find any takers in a troubled F&B industry.
=20
Group chairman Yuan Oeij said: =E2=80=9CWe (did) our best to ensure the =
continuity of our business and speak with interested parties =E2=80=93 =
whether investors or partners =E2=80=93 to explore different options.
=20
=E2=80=9CHowever, given the extremely tough climate for the F&B =
industry, everyone has been taking a very cautious stance.=E2=80=9D
=20
The Business Times understands that the group was put up for sale in =
March 2024 at an asking price of S$20 million. At the time, it had 12 =
Prive outlets and two restaurants =E2=80=93 Empress and Prive Grill. But =
by the start of 2025, the business had dwindled to six Prive outlets and =
the two restaurants.
=20
Oeij noted that business had started to slow down considerably since the =
end of 2023, =E2=80=9Cand just got worse each subsequent year=E2=80=9D. =
The business was plagued by the same issues affecting the industry: =
manpower, high rentals and rising food costs, compounded by a drop in =
traffic due to increased competition, overseas travel and changing =
spending patterns as customers cut back on their expenditure.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CSince 2024, we have been consolidating our operations, closing =
the non-profitable outlets, as well as reducing overheads. However, the =
combination of external market challenges and rising operational costs =
eventually left us with no viable path forward,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
He clarified that Commonwealth Concepts (CWC) =E2=80=93 which is taking =
over the Chinese restaurant Empress and Prive ACM at the Asian =
Civilisations Museum (ACM) =E2=80=93 was not buying the outlets, =
=E2=80=9Cbut taking over the operations to ensure continuity, which =
allows jobs to be preserved and for prior event bookings to be fulfilled =
without disruption=E2=80=9D. Oeij added that he was glad to be able to =
work with ACM to come to this arrangement.
=20
The group shared the news of its closure on social media, acknowledging =
the difficult decision.  It also announced that Empress would continue =
to operate as usual, and that Prive ACM would be converted to a Baker & =
Cook outlet, which would open on Sep 4.=20
=20
Baker & Cook is just one of several F&B brands owned by CWC =E2=80=93 a =
joint venture between Commonwealth Capital and Far East =
Organization=E2=80=99s Refinery Concepts. Its other brands include =
Marmalade Pantry, Bedrock Bar & Grill, Kinki and Pastamania.
=20
The Prive Group was established in 2007, with its first outlet at Keppel =
Bay. At its peak, it operated several nightclubs such as the now-defunct =
Stereolab and Mink at Pan Pacific Singapore. It then went on to focus on =
building the Prive brand with its casual cafe food and vegan menu =
options.

Prive Group closes all its restaurants; Far East=E2=80=99s Commonwealth =

The group will be appointing a professional independent financial =
adviser
=20
[SINGAPORE] The Prive Group has shut down all its restaurants from Aug =
31.
=20
In a message to its suppliers seen by The Business Times, the Prive =
Group said that two of their establishments, Chinese restaurant Empress =
and Prive ACM located at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), will be =
taken over by Commonwealth Concepts (CWC) and Baker & Cook, =
respectively, with effect from Sep 1.
=20
It also said that Prive will be appointing a professional independent =
financial adviser.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe understand they will be reaching out to suppliers =
directly,=E2=80=9D Prive said.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe hope you will give them the strong support that you have =
given us all these years with minimal disruption,=E2=80=9D the group =
added.
=20
The group was besieged by a string of restaurant closures before this =
development. Its 313 Somerset Prive outlet was repossessed by its =
landlord Lendlease in early 2025, and other Prive outlets at Jewel =
Changi Airport, Paragon, Kent Ridge, Chijmes, Katong, Tiong Bahru, =
Robertson Quay and Keppel Bay  also shut down earlier.
=20
Prior to the company=E2=80=99s closure, the remaining operating outlets =
were at Holland Village, Botanic Gardens and Wheelock Place.=20
=20
CWC was formed in 2021 through a joint venture with Singapore-based =
investment company Commonwealth Capital and Far East =
Organization=E2=80=99s food and beverage arm, Refinery Concepts. CWC =
owns 12 brands, including Baker & Cook as well as Fat Cow and Bedrock =
Bar & Grill.
=20
Brian Stampe, chief operating officer of CWC, said: =E2=80=9CIn =
collaboration with ACM, CWC has been handed over operations of the =
Empress and former Prive ACM units.=E2=80=9D
=20
=E2=80=9CWe will continue to fulfil the prior event bookings made with =
Empress, as well as Prive ACM. We would like to assure everyone that =
there will be no disruptions in service,=E2=80=9D he added.
=20
CWC is not involved with other Prive locations outside of ACM and the =
former Prive unit at ACM will be converted into a Baker & Cook outlet =
and will reopen on Sep 4, Stampe said.=20
=20
There has been a slew of food and beverage businesses shutting down in =
Singapore in the past few years as the number of closures hit a 20-year =
high in 2024.
=20
There were 3,047 F&B business closures last year, and the average =
monthly closures in the first quarter of this year are above 300.=20
=20
The closures include several well-known brands such as American chain =
Eggslut, which closed its last outlet in Singapore in early 2025, and =
Haidilao, which shuttered three restaurants in Bedok, Pasir Ris and =
Punngol. Burger & Lobster, the London-based chain, has also ceased =
Singapore operations.
=20
Local restaurants such as Superfood Kitchen and popular Muslim-owned =
omakase restaurant The Social Outcast have also shut down, citing rising =
operating costs, challenging business environments, and the lack of =
manpower for their closure.

The cuts amount to slightly over 3 per cent of its workforce, the =
national media organisation said in a press statement on Monday (Sep 1). =
It did not specify what departments are affected but said the =
retrenchment was organisation-wide.

=E2=80=9COver the past few years, the media environment has undergone =
rapid and fundamental transformation,=E2=80=9D said the company. =

becoming dominant, while traditional long-form content and platforms =
face growing pressure to compete for audience attention and commercial =
revenue.=E2=80=9D
=20
Mediacorp also cited complexity from global macroeconomic pressures such =
as inflation, trade disruptions and general volatility as reasons behind =
the manpower redundancies.
=20
The company said it has made efforts to keep pace with the changing =
media consumption environment while trying to preserve jobs, but the =
=E2=80=9Cscale and pace=E2=80=9D of change has necessitated cuts.

Indonesia government says economic fundamentals solid despite protests, =
vows to defend rupiah
=20
JAKARTA - Indonesia=E2=80=99s financial and economic regulators on Sept =
1 said economic fundamentals were strong, after widespread political =
protests sparked selling of stocks and the currency.
=20
The main stock index tumbled more than 3 per cent in opening trades =
before regaining some of the losses.
=20
The rupiah, which fell 0.9 per cent against the US dollar on Aug 29 as =
the protests escalated, firmed slightly on Sept 1 after the central bank =
vowed to defend the currency.
=20
Ahead of the market open, the central bank=E2=80=99s head of monetary =
management Erwin Gunawan Hutapea said Bank Indonesia would guard the =
rupiah to ensure its movement reflected fundamentals, including through =
currency intervention.
=20
The rupiah was little changed at 12,837 to the Singapore dollar as at =
noon on Sept 1, after weakening about 1.2 per cent in the past week.
=20
Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the economy was =
fundamentally solid and would get a boost from a planned incentive =
package, promising to =E2=80=9Cminimise the impact=E2=80=9D on the =
economy of the protests, in which at least eight people have died.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe hope for a peaceful and respectful situation that will =
support economic recovery,=E2=80=9D Mr Airlangga said at a joint press =
conference with the Indonesia Stock Exchange and financial services =
regulator.
=20
Students and civil society groups called off planned protests on Sept 1, =
citing heightened security measures.
=20
The demonstrations spread across Indonesia last week, initially over =
lawmakers=E2=80=99 benefits before they intensified after a police =
vehicle hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver on Aug 28.

President Prabowo Subianto has ordered the military and police to take =
stern action against rioters and looters, after homes of political party =
members and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati were ransacked.
=20
Some state buildings and public facilities such as toll booths in =
several cities were set ablaze.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe see that recovery and market confidence in the coming days =
will be strongly determined by how quickly social, political and =
security issues are addressed,=E2=80=9D Mr Rully Arya Wisnubroto, an =
analyst with brokerage Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said in a note =
to clients.

=E2=80=9CIndonesia=E2=80=99s economic conditions are relatively stable, =
though not outstanding. If investor confidence is not restored, =
short-term economic instability may occur,=E2=80=9D he added.

The economy grew by an annual 5.12 per cent in the second quarter, the =
fastest pace in two years, according to official data.

[JAKARTA] Protests in Jakarta, marked by vandalism and looting that =
damaged infrastructure, eased slightly on Monday (Sep 1) after President =
Prabowo Subianto scrapped a planned pay hike for lawmakers, but not =
before causing an estimated nine trillion rupiah (S$770 million) in =
economic losses, particularly in the Greater Jakarta area.=20

Violent protests in Jakarta damaged public transport infrastructure, =
with 22 TransJakarta bus stops vandalised, burned or looted, Governor =
Pramono Anung said on Monday. He estimated total losses at 55 billion =
rupiah.
Protests in Jakarta subsided on Monday after days of unrest and looting, =
as some demonstrators held back following weekend riots. In Makassar, =
where last weekend=E2=80=99s protests left four people dead, students =
marched to the local parliament building demanding justice for the =
victims, Kompas newspaper reported.=20
=20
A few mass demonstrations continued outside the parliament building in =
Central Jakarta, though in smaller numbers than last weekend. Police =
deployed around 5,000 personnel to secure the area, Central Jakarta =
Police Chief Commissioner Susatyo Purnomo Condro said.
=20
Protests are expected to continue in the coming days, with demonstrators =
urging Prabowo to enact policy reforms, including a review of the costly =
free lunch programme and redirecting its budget towards initiatives that =
could generate jobs and curb lay-offs.
=20
The Indonesian Student Alliance, which had planned to stage another =
protest outside parliament, said it decided not to return to the streets =
on Monday after last week=E2=80=99s rally ended in violence. Prabowo had =
earlier ordered firm action against violent protesters and increased =
security at key sites.=20
=20
Unrests in Jakarta have led to cancellations at hotels and restaurants, =
particularly in the city centre. Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of =
Indonesia Hotel and Restaurants Association, noted that cancellations =
began on Friday after demonstrations escalated and turned deadly, driven =
not only by safety concerns but also by heavy traffic and restricted =
access to central areas.
=20
He added that while hotels and restaurants are still operating normally, =
the risk of temporary closures remains if tensions flare up again. =
=E2=80=9CThere is still anxiety that the unrest could escalate, so we =
have advised hotels to strengthen their security,=E2=80=9D he noted.

if the government=E2=80=99s response is seen as inadequate -=E2=80=93 or =
delayed =E2=80=93 prolonged protests could hurt private-sector =
investment and dampen spending on durable goods and tourism. =E2=80=9CIt =
is unclear to us at this juncture what kind of corrective actions it =
would take to appease the protests,=E2=80=9D he wrote in a note.
=20
In Jakarta, military personnel were deployed to guard commercial =
facilities, including shopping malls and office towers, The Business =
Times observed.=20
=20
Foot traffic in Jakarta=E2=80=99s Thamrin and Sudirman business =
districts was noticeably lighter than usual, as many offices implemented =
work-from-home arrangements amid lingering concerns that unrest could =
flare up again.
=20
Public transport services, including TransJakarta and the mass rapid =
transit, resumed normal operations on Monday after being targeted by =
protesters.=20
=20
Growth risks
Analysts said that rising political tensions in Indonesia are =
heightening economic risks, especially in the wake of the 19 per cent US =
tariffs that came into effect in August.
=20
In a note, OCBC economists Lavanya Venkateswaran and Ahmad Enver noted =
that the impact of the tariffs is likely to start showing in August =
data. They projected that the economy will slow to 4.5 per cent in the =
second half of the year, down from 5 per cent in the first half, =
reflecting the combined effects of external and domestic pressures.
=20
They added: =E2=80=9CIt remains to be seen whether the protests will =
prompt any significant policy changes under the Prabowo administration, =
but this is not our base case.=E2=80=9D
=20
In a note, S&P Global Ratings analysts said that protests in several =
cities are unlikely to escalate to a level that would undermine =
political stability. They added that policy adjustments could include =
measures to support the economy and boost social spending.
=20
However, the analysts warned that if economic pressures intensify and =
fuel social tensions, it could become increasingly challenging for the =
government to balance competing spending priorities while maintaining =
fiscal discipline.=20

Indonesia=E2=80=99s gas-reliant manufacturers =E2=80=93 from those in =
fertilisers and petrochemicals to ceramics and steel =E2=80=93 as they =

=20
Already, the tight conditions have led the authorities to ask overseas =
gas customers to accept shipment delays and to urge exporters to defer =
cargoes well into 2026, a decision which holds significant implications =
for importers.
=20
Pang Lu Ming, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, said that while sellers =
and buyers may reallocate volumes, the original terms of the contract =
must still be honoured.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CDeviations from the contract should be accounted for in =
specific clauses within the contract which may allow for a swap of =
volumes,=E2=80=9D he noted. =E2=80=9CIf there are any deviations, =
negotiations and possible reparations will be required between the =
parties involved before further actions can be taken.=E2=80=9D

Responding to queries from The Business Times, the Energy Market =

stable. =E2=80=9CEMA will continue to closely monitor developments and =
work with industry partners to ensure Singapore=E2=80=99s energy =
security and price stability,=E2=80=9D it added.
=20
To safeguard against potential disruptions, Singapore sources natural =
gas from a diverse range of suppliers, including liquefied natural gas =
(LNG) from around the world and piped natural gas from Malaysia.
=20
Indonesia has been a pillar of South-east Asia=E2=80=99s gas trade, =
supplying Singapore through pipelines and shipping LNG cargoes to buyers =
across Asia and beyond for decades.=20
=20
Now, with the gas crunch on, Indonesian factories and other industrial =
users are demanding more fuel just as production is slowing, making it a =
challenge for the country to both satisfy local needs and honour export =
commitments.=20
=20
BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said that despite growth prospects for =
Indonesia LNG production, exports are unlikely to rise significantly in =
the near term as the government prioritises domestic consumption.
=20
In the first half of this year, Indonesia=E2=80=99s total gas =
consumption hit 5,598 billion British thermal units (BTU) per day, with =
nearly 70 per cent consumed domestically, and the remainder exported, =
underscoring the ongoing balancing act between meeting local demand and =
overseas commitments.
=20
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources projects =
Indonesia=E2=80=99s natural gas demand to exceed 6,000 billion BTU per =
day between 2025 and 2030, driven by rising industrial consumption and =
the government=E2=80=99s energy-mix programme.
=20
Swap deal
A multiparty gas swap was launched by SKK Migas, Indonesia=E2=80=99s =
upstream regulator, on Aug 22 to ease immediate domestic shortages while =
maintaining existing export contracts.
=20
The arrangement redirects 27 billion BTU a day from the West Natuna =
Supply Group, which includes Medco E&P Natuna, Premier Oil Natuna Sea =
and Star Energy (Kakap), to state-owned gas distributor Perusahaan Gas =
Negara (PGN) for domestic delivery.
=20
Physical volumes are transported through pipelines operated by Medco E&P =
Grissik and PetroChina International Jabung in South Sumatra, which =
channel natural gas from Indonesia to Singapore. The deal involves key =
upstream contractors and buyers, including state-owned Pertamina and =
overseas buyers such as Singapore=E2=80=99s Sembcorp Gas.
=20
In March, Sembcorp announced that it had terminated the gas sales =
agreement its unit had signed to import piped natural gas from =
Indonesia=E2=80=99s Mako gas fields, citing regulatory hurdles.=20
=20
Pang from Rystad Energy said that swaps occur only under long-term =
agreements, where the characteristics of the gas molecules are clearly =
defined. =E2=80=9CThis is usually possible in regions with =
well-integrated pipeline networks.=E2=80=9D
=20
Natural gas powers more than 92 per cent of Singapore=E2=80=99s =
electricity, sourced mainly through pipelines from Malaysia and =
Indonesia. The rest is imported as LNG.
=20
Balancing act
Under President Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia is racing to boost =
industrialisation and achieve 8 per cent growth, but the recent gas =
crisis shows that the country is caught between a rock and a hard place, =
balancing rising domestic demand with declining output.
=20
In an information disclosure report released on Aug 15, PGN said that =
gas distribution from upstream oil and gas contractors fell in August, =
temporarily disrupting deliveries to several customers in West Java and =
parts of Sumatra.=20
=20
PGN attributed the disruption to an unplanned shutdown at existing gas =
suppliers and delays in finalising additional supplies, which affected =
both required volumes and distribution stability in the affected areas.=20
=20
Manufacturers then raised the alarm.=20
=20
Seven manufacturing sub-sectors currently benefit from the =
government=E2=80=99s subsidised gas price programme, locally known as =
HGBT: fertiliser, petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, ceramics, =
glassware and rubber gloves. But recent cuts in allocations have led to =
operational strain.=20
=20
Indonesian media reported that two tableware factories in Tangerang =
halted production and laid off around 700 workers earlier this month, =
citing gas supply restrictions.
=20
The Ministry of Industry confirmed the pressure on manufacturers, with =
spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief warning that the shortage is =
hitting economic activity across sectors. =E2=80=9CThis crisis is having =
a severe impact on the manufacturing industry,=E2=80=9D he said in a =
statement. =E2=80=9CIt affects not only manufacturers, but also =
investment sentiment, production processes and job creation.=E2=80=9D
=20
Industry groups warned that the situation could worsen. =
Indonesia=E2=80=99s Olefin, Aromatic and Plastic Industry Association =
has criticised the government=E2=80=99s handling of the crisis, saying =
prolonged shortages could trigger mass layoffs.
=20
Jakarta-based fatty acid manufacturer Sumi Asih reported that since Aug =
13, it has been receiving less than half of its contracted gas volumes, =
which were initially capped at 48 per cent of the agreed quota and =
gradually lifted to around 70 per cent. This has left the company =
struggling to meet commitments to buyers in China and Europe.
=20
In response to queries from BT, PGN said that the situation has been =
resolved, with industrial customers under the HGBT programme now =
receiving supplies based on the government=E2=80=99s reallocation =
scheme.
=20
Temporary relief
However, industry experts cautioned that the respite may be short-lived =
without deeper structural reforms.
=20
Prateek Pandey, senior vice-president at Rystad Energy, said that the =
swap could help secure additional volumes for the domestic market in the =
near term, likely through the end of this year and into next. =
=E2=80=9CBut over the longer horizon, Indonesia will need to either =
secure new long-term import contracts or accelerate the development of =
its substantial domestic resources,=E2=80=9D he explained.
=20
Indonesia=E2=80=99s LNG exports fell gradually from 17 million tonnes =
per annum (mtpa) in 2015 to 10 mtpa in 2023, largely due to declining =
output from the Tangguh and Bontang LNG plants and the =
government=E2=80=99s decision to prioritise domestic consumption.
=20
Production in South Sumatra, home to key blocks such as Pertamina EP, =
the Corridor Block and Jambi Merang, has been steadily falling for five =
years.
=20
Few new supply projects have come online to offset the declines, forcing =
regulators to redirect existing supplies to fertiliser plants, power =
stations and industrial users. New demand is also emerging, most notably =
from a power plant in Batam.
=20
Upcoming projects such as the Abadi LNG project, Indonesia Deepwater =
Development and exploration in the Andaman Sea could theoretically meet =
both domestic and export demand, but delays remain a major risk.
=20
=E2=80=9CIndonesia has enough potential to meet domestic demand while =
continuing exports,=E2=80=9D Pandey said. =E2=80=9CThe real risk is =
delays in development, which could affect investor sentiment.=E2=80=9D
=20
Indonesia is not alone in facing gas supply challenges. Malaysia may =
redirect more Sarawak output to domestic use, while Australia has long =

Indonesian stock, bond selloff extends after weekend of unrest
[JAKARTA] A sell-off in Indonesian stocks and bonds continued on Monday =
(Sep 1), weighed by growing concerns over political stability in =
South-east Asia=E2=80=99s biggest economy.
=20
The country=E2=80=99s equity benchmark fell as much as 3.6 per cent, the =
most in nearly five months, before trimming losses to close down about =
1.5 per cent, with financial shares including Bank Rakyat Indonesia =
among the biggest drags. The move came after protests heightened over =
the weekend in response to rising living costs and inequality.=20
=20
Stress also was evident in the bond market, with yields on the =
nation=E2=80=99s benchmark 10-year government paper up seven basis =
points to 6.4 per cent, the highest in almost three weeks. The rupiah =
was steady as the central bank continued its intervention to keep the =
currency stable.
=20
The rout in Indonesian stocks and debt that started Friday marks a =
reversal of investor mood, when some global funds had just started =
rotating back into South-east Asian assets given lower valuations and =
potential monetary easing. Political turbulence, which is also plaguing =
Thailand at the moment, heightens the risk of foreign capital outflows =
that have accelerated in recent days.=20
=20
Indonesia=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cpolitical risk will rise, and so will the =
equity risk premium,=E2=80=9D said John Foo, founder of Valverde =
Investment Partners in Singapore. =E2=80=9CWe are underweight on =
Indonesia as the valuations do not reflect the underlying issues in the =
economy.=E2=80=9D=20
=20
President Prabowo Subianto cancelled a trip to China following the =
deadly unrest as demonstrators targeted the homes of Indonesia=E2=80=99s =
finance minister and several lawmakers. On Sunday, Prabowo announced =
parliament will remove hefty lawmaker perks that had been a source of =
ire for many protesters.
=20
Outrage
Protests in Indonesia were sparked last week by outrage over =
lawmakers=E2=80=99 housing allowances- nearly 10 times the monthly =
minimum wage in Jakarta =E2=80=93 and fuelled by tax hikes, mass =
layoffs, and inflation that have disproportionately hit lower-income =
Indonesians.
=20
Banks were among the biggest drags on the stock benchmark, with Bank =
Rakyat, Bank Central Asia, and Bank Mandiri Persero all down more than 4 =
per cent intraday.
=20
Any capital outflows would first hit the financial sector, Prasetya =
Gunadi, head of equity research at Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia, wrote in =
a note. =E2=80=9CBanks remain the most exposed, given their large index =
weight and potential liquidity stress if political instability triggers =
capital withdrawals.=E2=80=9D
=20
Indonesia=E2=80=99s stock market attracted a net US$676 million from =
foreign investors in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. =
Its equity benchmark is up 8 per cent this year, having reached a record =
high before the unrest erupted.
=20
On the currency front, the rupiah is one of the weaker performers in =
Asia this year, down over 2 per cent against the greenback.
=20
=E2=80=9CIndonesian stocks are poised for more declines with political =
risks clouding the outlook. The recent escalation weakens the outlook =
and raises the equity risk premium,=E2=80=9D said Mary Nicola, MLIV =
macro strategist. =E2=80=9CThat will keep Indonesian assets under =
pressure, and likely unwind the inflows seen in August.=E2=80=9D
=20
BNY downgraded its outlook on the rupiah to neutral from positive on =
Monday, because of the near-term political factors, according to Wee =
Khoon Chong, a senior strategist in Hong Kong.
=20
=E2=80=9CWhile we think such unrest is likely to be short-lived, =
investors will no doubt de-risk or increase hedges on their Indonesia =
portfolios,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CAn acknowledgement of discontent =
and positive social and market reforms towards transparency and equity =
might restore confidence.=E2=80=9D

Thai woes=20
Political turmoil is also rocking Thailand, where politicians are =
jockeying to lead the next government after the disqualification of =
Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
=20
Thailand has struggled for decades to overcome political infighting, =
contributing to slower economic growth compared with regional rivals. =
Anutin Charnvirakul, a conservative politician, claimed late on Friday =
to have sufficient support from lawmakers to become prime minister, =
saying the nation must not =E2=80=9Ccome to a standstill.=E2=80=9D
=20
Valverde=E2=80=99s Foo was comparatively sanguine about Thailand, citing =
cheap valuations and the hope that a new prime minister will stimulate =
the economy. =E2=80=9CThe market is ready for a change in PM in =
Thailand,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
For BNY=E2=80=99s Chong, the baht is likely to remain in its current =
trading range despite the rising political uncertainty, thanks in part =
to the downtrend in the US dollar.=20
=20
Foreign investors have pulled US$670 million out of Thai stocks so far =
this year. The Thai equities benchmark has dropped about 12 per cent =
since 2025 began, with the baht up over 5 per cent against the US =
dollar.
=20
Long-term outlook
Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Aletheia Capital in Singapore, =
argued the current turbulence in both nations doesn=E2=80=99t =

Prabowo has prioritised economic expansion and pursued a populist agenda =
since coming to power last year, including a massive free meals =

wealth fund, Danantara, which oversees nearly 900 state firms and has =
reported US$1 trillion in assets under management.

Impasse in Thailand as big party stalls on deciding who to back for PM =20
The opposition People=E2=80=99s Party will not join any government but =
with control of nearly a third of the house seats
=20
[BANGKOK] The biggest party in Thailand=E2=80=99s parliament held out on =
Monday (Sep 1) in deciding whom it would back to form the next =
government, prolonging uncertainty as two rival camps jostled for its =
crucial votes following the prime minister=E2=80=99s sacking.
=20
The opposition People=E2=80=99s Party will not join any government but =
with control of nearly a third of the house seats, it is a potential =
kingmaker that can break the political deadlock caused by =
Friday=E2=80=99s dismissal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra by the =
Constitutional Court for an ethics violation.
=20
Lawmakers of the People=E2=80=99s Party met on Monday to weigh the =
merits of backing Paetongtarn=E2=80=99s ruling Pheu Thai party, or =
Bhumjaithai, a renegade party that quit the governing coalition in June =
and is mounting its own bold challenge.
=20
=E2=80=9CThere was a wide exchange of views today and the party will =
convene again tomorrow,=E2=80=9D said People=E2=80=99s Party =
spokesperson Parit Wacharasindhu.
=20
=E2=80=9CTo be straight, we don=E2=80=99t trust either,=E2=80=9D he =
said, when asked if the two camps would honour the party=E2=80=99s =
demands that a referendum be held on amending the constitution and =
parliament be dissolved within four months.
=20
In the latest upheaval in a turbulent, two-decade battle for power and =
patronage among Thailand=E2=80=99s rival elites, 39-year-old Paetongtarn =
became the sixth premier from or backed by the billionaire Shinawatra =
family to be ousted by the military or judiciary and the second in the =
space of a year.
=20
All to play for
The once-dominant Pheu Thai, founded by Paetongtarn=E2=80=99s =
deep-pocketed father Thaksin Shinawatra, faces a big task in shoring up =
a coalition that has haemorrhaged public support, opening the door to a =
spree of dealmaking by its former alliance partner Bhumjaithai and its =
ambitious leader Anutin Charnvirakul.
=20
Parliament is due to hold a special session starting Wednesday and the =
secretary-general of the house told Reuters it could hold a vote on a =
new prime minister this week, if parties were ready to nominate a =
candidate.
=20
With neither group guaranteed the votes and much still to play for, the =
process to elect a prime minister could be protracted and there is no =
time limit on forming a new government.
=20
With political interests shifting, bitter histories of betrayal and big =
war chests to work with, there is plenty of scope for switches in =
allegiance, bringing the prospect of deadlock at a time of weak growth =
and a dim outlook for South-east Asia=E2=80=99s second-biggest economy.
=20
The spotlight in the days ahead will remain firmly on the hugely popular =
People=E2=80=99s Party, a reincarnation of Move Forward, which won the =
2023 election on an anti-establishment platform but was blocked from =
power by lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

with People=E2=80=99s Party and both said they were ready to comply with =
its demands.

Asia-Pacific hotel deal value falls 23% to US$4.7 billion in H1 2025: =
JLL
Macroeconomic uncertainty results in investors gravitating to safe-haven =
markets, even as decision-making timelines lengthen
=20
[SINGAPORE] Hotel investors have turned more cautious in the first half =
of 2025, deploying less capital into the hospitality sector in =
Asia-Pacific amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
=20
Asia-Pacific hotel transaction value stood at US$4.7 billion in H1, 23 =
per cent lower than the US$5.7 billion recorded in the same period in =
the previous year, according to JLL.
=20
Japan continued to lead regional hotel investment with US$1.5 billion in =
transactions, followed by China which had US$744 million in deals. =
Investors spent US$664 million acquiring hotels in Australia, while in =
Singapore, they deployed US$546 million in the same period. South Korea =
rounded up the top markets, with US$504 million invested in the segment. =

=20
JLL said: =E2=80=9CInvestors have gravitated to safe-haven markets, =
while decision-making timelines lengthened. At the same time, the =
bid-ask spread between seller expectations and buyer valuations has also =
widened with sellers holding firm on price expectations and buyers =
applying greater scrutiny, leading to extended due diligence periods on =
both sides of transactions.=E2=80=9D=20
=20
High-net-worth individuals from within the region emerged as =
increasingly active buyers in H1, seeking portfolio diversification =
through hotel investments, with capital invested into hotels growing 54 =
per cent from the same period last year.=20
=20
In Singapore, investors gravitated towards boutique hotels. Duxton =
Reserve was sold in May 2025 for S$80 million, or about S$1.6 million =
per key. The 49-key boutique hotel was sold by Singapore-based =
hospitality company The Garcha Group to Lotus One Investment, the =
investment arm of Lotus Singapore, a family office focused on ventures =
in South Asia.=20
In April, the 48-key shophouse hotel 21 Carpenter was sold by 8M Real =
Estate to Indonesian-born, Singapore-based billionaire Leo KoGuan. =
According to industry sources, it was sold for S$100 million, or about =
S$2.1 million per key.=20

Hybrid hotels, with an extended-stay component, are also attracting =
investment from private-equity groups.=20

Tan Ling Wei, senior vice-president of investment sales at JLL Hotels & =

and long-term capital value.=E2=80=9D=20

Looking ahead
For the full year, hotel transaction value in Singapore is projected to =
reach US$1.2 billion, JLL said. This is higher than the US$744 million =
recorded in 2024.
=20
Across the entire Asia-Pacific region, hotel transaction value is =
expected to total US$12.8 billion, an almost 5 per cent increase from =
US$12.2 billion in 2024.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CThis forecast anticipates accelerated investment activity in =
the second half of the year as the backlog of deals in due diligence are =
expected to settle then,=E2=80=9D noted JLL.
=20
It added: =E2=80=9CAlthough institutional investors remain selective, =
private capital is moving decisively to secure prime hospitality assets =
that offer both defensive income characteristics and growth potential, =
which should ensure an uptick in activity in this year and into the =
next.=E2=80=9D
=20
JLL expects private-equity funds, family offices, and regional operators =
with access to private capital to emerge as the most active buyers for =
the rest of the year as they seek assets requiring operational expertise =
to maximise their value.=20
=20
Some analysts, however, are turning less sanguine on the outlook for =
Singapore=E2=80=99s tourism and hospitality sector.=20

tourists, 2.4 per cent higher than in the year-ago period, according to =
latest data from the Singapore Tourism Board.=20

A report by OCBC Investment Research noted that in June 2025, revenue =

=20
While the Singapore government has put in significant effort to =
revitalise the tourism landscape through the opening of attractions such =

New Zealand home-building approvals stuck in 15-month slumber
The government wants to reinvigorate the industry as it tries to revive =
economic growth
=20
[WELLINGTON] New Zealand home-building approvals remain in a slumber =
that extends back more than a year, adding to signs that weakness in the =
key construction industry may persist.
=20
There were 33,879 consents issued in the 12 months to July, Statistics =
New Zealand said on Monday (Sep 1). That=E2=80=99s the 15th straight =
month that the annual total has been below 35,000.
=20
Construction has failed to stir even as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand =
(RBNZ) cut its Official Cash Rate by 250 basis points since August last =
year. Worries about job security and a sluggish economic recovery have =
pushed potential home builders to the sidelines, while global economic =
uncertainty has hurt investor sentiment and curbed new residential =
developments.
=20
Construction contracted 9.3 per cent in the 12 months to March, costing =
jobs and forcing some firms to close. Concrete production in the 12 =
months to June was the lowest in more than 10 years.
=20
The government wants to reinvigorate the industry as it tries to revive =
economic growth and has unveiled a range of regulatory adjustments aimed =
at smoothing approval processes and making it cheaper to get a house =
built.
=20
The sector may also get a lift if the RBNZ reduces borrowing costs =
further after it signalled on Aug 20 that there may be another 50 basis =
points of cuts to come before Christmas.
=20
Weakness in the underlying housing market also hampers the construction =
sector by making apartments and retirement village units less attractive =
for those who may want to downsize from a family home. House prices fell =
for the fourth straight month in July.
=20
Today=E2=80=99s report showed 1,483 retirement units approved in the 12 =
months to July, down 16 per cent on the previous year. Apartment =

followed a 56 per cent slump in the period to July 2024. BLOOMBERG

New Zealand opens luxury home market to golden visa holders
The Active Investor Plus visa offers residency in exchange for a =
significant investment
=20
[WELLINGTON] New Zealand will loosen its ban on foreigners buying =
houses, opening the door for wealthy investors to purchase luxury =
properties as part of a push to revive its sluggish economy.
=20
The coalition government on Monday (Sep 1) said that it will allow =
holders of so-called golden visas to buy houses worth at least NZ$5 =
million (S$3 million), carving out an exemption to restrictions that =
have largely kept overseas buyers out of the market since 2018. The =
change will not take effect until the end of the year, when reforms to =
the Overseas Investment Act are passed into law, a spokesperson for =
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said.
=20
=E2=80=9CGlobally, New Zealand has a deserved reputation as a great =
place to live and we want to grow our economy,=E2=80=9D Luxon said. =
=E2=80=9CBy opening our door just a little to allow significant =
investors to own a home, we will help attract more of those who want to =
contribute to the community and country.=E2=80=9D
=20
The move underscores Luxon=E2=80=99s bid to lure more foreign capital to =
the South Pacific nation and comes five months after the relaunch of New =
Zealand=E2=80=99s golden visa. Designed to attract high-net-worth =
individuals, the Active Investor Plus visa offers residency in exchange =
for a significant investment.
=20
There were 308 applications for the visa covering 1,000 people as at Aug =
31, amounting to a potential total minimum investment of NZ$1.9 billion, =
data from Immigration New Zealand shows. Around 40 per cent of =
applicants are from the US.=20
=20
At the moment, participants in the visa programme are largely banned =
from buying property in the country.
=20
Only New Zealand citizens, residents, and nationals from Australia and =
Singapore have been free to buy homes for the past seven years, =
following a clampdown by then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern amid fears =
that offshore buyers were fuelling a housing crisis. Adding to the =
pressure was a passport-for-sale scandal involving PayPal co-founder =
Peter Thiel.
=20
There are about 7,000 houses in New Zealand valued at more than NZ$5 =
million, just 0.4 per cent of the nation=E2=80=99s housing stock, =
according to property consultancy Cotality. Around 4,500 are in =
Auckland, the nation=E2=80=99s largest city, and about 1,250 are in the =
South Island ski-resort town of Queenstown.
=20
However, only around 350 of those trophy properties are typically put up =
for sale each year, meaning the pool of homes available to foreign =
buyers will be small.
=20
When Ardern first announced the foreign buyer ban in 2017, she said that =
it was to reduce property speculation and make it easier for first-time =
buyers to enter the market.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their =
first home, so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and =
driving up prices. Kiwis should not be outbid like this,=E2=80=9D she =
said at the time.
=20
House price impact
Still, data showed foreigners accounted for only 2 to 3.5 per cent of =
sales before the ban.
=20
=E2=80=9CThis change navigates a path between those who do not want =
foreign ownership opened up, and the desire to attract high-net-worth =
investors by deepening their connection to our country to help grow the =
economy,=E2=80=9D Luxon said of Monday=E2=80=99s announcement.
=20
The impact on affordability for ordinary New Zealanders will be =
negligible, said Cotality chief property economist Kelvin Davidson.
=20
=E2=80=9CThere might be some people out there who are worried about what =
this is going to do to local house prices. Well, it probably =
won=E2=80=99t do much,=E2=80=9D Davidson said. =E2=80=9CFor the wider =

New World=E2=80=99s Cheng family weighs capital injection by year-end: =

The plan under discussion would establish a joint venture to provide =

=20
[HONG KONG] New World Development=E2=80=99s controlling shareholder, the =
billionaire Cheng family, is considering injecting capital into the =
debt-laden builder as early as the end of the year, according to people =
familiar with the matter.
=20
The family of Hong Kong tycoon Henry Cheng is willing to contribute =
about HK$10 billion (S$1.6 billion) and is seeking a partner that can =
provide a roughly similar amount for an equity stake, said the people, =
who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.=20
=20
The plan under discussion would establish a joint venture to provide =
liquidity to New World, the people added. The talks are ongoing and =
details about the deal=E2=80=99s size and structure could change.

Blackstone and CapitaLand Group are among the firms engaged in the =
capital injection discussions, the people said. The two companies have =
also been in talks with New World to buy some of its assets, Bloomberg =
News reported earlier.=20
=20
New World=E2=80=99s shares extended their gains after the news, jumping =
as much as 10.3 per cent to HK$7.3 and putting them on track for their =
highest intra-day price in more than three weeks, according to =
Bloomberg-compiled data. Some of its US dollar bonds also rose by at =
least one cent, according to several credit traders.
=20
Despite securing a record US$11 billion loan refinancing deal earlier =
this year, New World still needs more funding to help it cut debt and =
sustain its operations, as Hong Kong=E2=80=99s property sector remains =
in the doldrums.=20
=20
The company has been in talks over a potential Deutsche Bank-led loan =
deal, but missed a self-imposed target to complete the financing in =
mid-July. As of late last month, no bank has committed to the deal and =
parties involved expect the talks to drag on, the people said.=20
=20
Some potential investors involved in the talks have asked that the =
family offer its holdings in the Hong Kong-listed property firm as a =
security to hedge against potential risks, or have demanded dividend =
returns for their equity investment, some of the people added.=20
=20
It remains unclear if the family would agree to any of the conditions, =
they said. The potential investors are not willing to commit to a deal =
if the family will not provide capital, the people explained.
=20
The Cheng family office and New World did not immediately respond to =
requests for comment. Blackstone, CapitaLand and Deutsche Bank declined =
to comment.
=20
Octus reported last month that Blackstone and the Cheng family were =
considering co-investing about US$2.5 billion into New World, with =
options discussed for the investment in the form of preferred or =
ordinary equity.
=20
While the Cheng family largely sat on the sidelines when New World was =
negotiating its loan refinancing with banks earlier this year, it did =
inject liquidity into the firm in 2023, when it bought out a subsidiary =
for HK$35.5 billion. The Chengs own about 45 per cent share of the =
builder.
=20
New World=E2=80=99s debt crisis stems from an aggressive expansion that =

type of international relations, Xi said in opening remarks addressing =
more than 20 world leaders at a two-day summit held in northern =
China=E2=80=99s port city Tianjin.

=E2=80=9CWe should advocate for equal and orderly multipolarisation of =
the world, inclusive economic globalisation and promote the construction =
of a more just and equitable global governance system,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
=E2=80=9CWe must take advantage of the mega-scale market... to improve =
the level of trade and investment facilitation,=E2=80=9D said Xi, urging =
the bloc to boost cooperation in fields including energy, =

=E2=80=9CThis, in turn, lays the political and socio-economic groundwork =
for the formation of a new system of stability and security in =
Eurasia,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
=E2=80=9CThis security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic =
models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of =
countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure =
its own security at the expense of others.=E2=80=9D

nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and =
observer countries in recent years.

Xi called on organisation partners to =E2=80=9Coppose Cold War mentality =
and bloc confrontation=E2=80=9D and to support multilateral trade =
systems. That was an apparent dig at US President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s =
tariff war which has disproportionately affected developing economies =
such as India, whose exports were hit with a 50 per cent levy last week.

China will provide two billion yuan (S$360 million) of free aid to =

Alibaba shares soar most since 2022 after making headway in AI
The company has also leveraged the growth of an international arm that =
encompasses some of the world=E2=80=99s most-recognised online shopping =
platforms from Lazada to AliExpress
=20
[HONG KONG] Alibaba Group Holding=E2=80=99s stock leapt more than 18 per =
cent after reporting a surge in revenue from artificial intelligence =
(AI), underscoring the steady progress it=E2=80=99s making against =
rivals in a post-DeepSeek Chinese development frenzy.
=20
China=E2=80=99s e-commerce leader posted a triple-digit percentage gain =
in AI-related product revenue as well as a better-than-anticipated 26 =
per cent jump in sales from the cloud division, the business most =
closely tied to the AI boom.
=20
That helped assuage investors nervous about the fallout from a worsening =
battle with Meituan and  <http://jd.com/> JD.com in Internet commerce. =
Its shares gained their most intraday since November 2022 in Hong Kong, =
after investors looked past a disappointing 2 per cent rise in revenue =
and a surprise decline in operating income. Alibaba=E2=80=99s rally also =
helped energise the broader AI sphere: Ernie developer Baidu gained as =
much as 5.8 per cent, while Tencent Holdings climbed.
=20
=E2=80=9CAlibaba=E2=80=99s earnings underscore a bifurcation within =
China tech: AI is delivering scalable growth, while traditional =
consumer-facing segments remain mired in destructive price =
competition,=E2=80=9D said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at =
Saxo Markets.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe triple-digit surge in AI revenue and robust cloud sales =
show Alibaba is repositioning for longer-term relevance in the tech =
stack, not just retail dominance,=E2=80=9D she added.
=20
Alibaba=E2=80=99s progress in AI, where it is considered among the =
frontrunners in Chinese AI development, helped gloss over concerns about =
an intense price war with JD and Meituan in the giant food delivery =
sector.
That three-way battle has dealt more damage than anticipated to some of =
the country=E2=80=99s e-commerce leaders: JD=E2=80=99s profit halved in =
the quarter while Meituan warned of major losses, triggering a US$27 =
billion sell-off of the three companies=E2=80=99 shares last week.
=20
The AI element helps explain why Alibaba=E2=80=99s stock has easily =
outpaced its more commerce-reliant rivals this year. Alibaba has also =
leveraged the growth of an international arm that encompasses some of =
the world=E2=80=99s most-recognised online shopping platforms from =
Lazada to AliExpress.

It has =E2=80=9CChina=E2=80=99s best AI enabler thesis=E2=80=9D, Morgan =
Stanley analysts, including Gary Yu, wrote in a research note. =
That=E2=80=99s as losses from meal delivery and instant commerce peak =
this quarter, they said.
=20
Investors are now focused on whether Alibaba will pursue that =
margin-eroding competition, at a time it=E2=80=99s declared record =
amounts of spending towards developing AI services and computing.
=20
On Friday, commerce chief Jiang Fan argued that investments in quick =
commerce, food delivery and instant shopping had already driven 20 per =
cent growth in users on its main Taobao marketplace. The fledgling =
division has, in four months, grown to the point that it can begin to =
achieve economies of scale, he added.
=20
Alibaba is simultaneously making substantial investments in the AI =
field, developing large language models to avoid falling behind in a =
critical technological race.
=20
The company views AI as essential to its future, whether in terms of =
providing cloud computing, powering its core business or coming up with =
services to challenge OpenAI and DeepSeek. CEO Eddie Wu went as far as =
saying in February that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is now =
the company=E2=80=99s primary objective.
=20
Just last week, Alibaba updated its own open-source video generating =
model, part of a string of recent upgrades that span the gamut from =
agentic AI services to chatbots.
=20
It remains to be seen if Alibaba can turn AI into a money-spinner in an =
increasingly competitive field. From Baidu to Tencent, Chinese firms are =
enhancing and releasing AI models at a frenetic pace, increasing the =
pressure on Alibaba to deliver breakthroughs.

China=E2=80=99s factory activity grows at quickest pace in five months: =
private PMI
Economists say economic fundamentals may worsen in the second half of =
the year
=20
[BEIJING] China=E2=80=99s factory activity in August expanded at the =
quickest pace in five months on the back of rising new orders, a =
private-sector survey showed on Monday (Sep 1).
=20
The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, =
rose to 50.5 in August from 49.5 in July, beating analysts=E2=80=99 =
expectations of 49.7 in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark separates growth =
from contraction.
=20
The result was better than that of an official survey released on Sunday =
that showed factory activity shrinking for the fifth straight month.
=20
=E2=80=9CNotably, the manufacturing sector is helping the recovery, but =
this rebound is patchy,=E2=80=9D said Yao Yu, founder of RatingDog.
=20
=E2=80=9CWith weak domestic demand, potentially overstretched external =
orders, and slow profit recovery, the durability of the improvement =
depends on whether exports truly stabilise and whether domestic demand =
can pick up pace.=E2=80=9D
=20
New export orders continued to contract in August, marking the fifth =
straight monthly decline, the RatingDog survey showed.
=20
With Chinese exporters bracing for a peak in holiday shipments amid a =
trade truce with the United States, American shoppers looking for fake =
Christmas trees and holiday decor this year will have fewer choices and =
face higher prices as tariffs force retailers to scale back orders, =
Reuters reported.
=20
However, overall new order growth accelerated to the quickest since =
March, leading to a renewed accumulation of backlogged work, according =
to the survey. The rate at which unfinished business increased was the =
quickest in six months.
=20
Despite greater capacity pressures, manufacturers remained cautious when =
hiring, opting instead to shed staff for a fifth consecutive month.
=20
As China strives to curb industrial overcapacity, average input costs =
rose at the steepest pace since November 2024, but still remained below =
the series average. Higher raw material costs were cited as a key reason =
for the increase in expenses.
=20
To cope with rising costs, some producers raised their output charges =
while others were unable to pass on higher expenses to buyers due to =
intense competition, leaving average selling prices unchanged in August.
=20
Supplier lead times lengthened for the sixth month in a row in August, =
as respondents cited shipping delays and logistics constraints.
=20
Overall, factory bosses remained positive on the one-year outlook for =
output, with optimism at the highest since March amid hopes that =
economic conditions will improve and company expansion plans will help =
drive new sales.

Economists say economic fundamentals may worsen in the second half of =
the year, as US tariffs and payback from frontloading shipments to get =
ahead of the duties, alongside the still stagnant property sector, weigh =
on growth momentum. REUTERS

[BEIJING] China=E2=80=99s mega banks are under pressure from rising =
allowances for loan losses and a continued margin erosion in their =
mission to support the world=E2=80=99s second-largest economy.=20
=20
The lenders, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), on =
Friday (Aug 29) reported falling or weak earnings for the first half of =
2025 as they continued to pump out new loans to China=E2=80=99s =
struggling consumers.
=20
Overall, the five biggest banks set aside allowances for losses on loans =
of 3.5 trillion yuan (S$630 billion), in the first half, up almost 6 per =
cent from the end of last year.
=20
Their finances are come under increasing strain due to their duties to =
help lift the economy out with cheap lending and loan subsidies. The =
sector=E2=80=99s overall margin contracted further to a record low of =
1.42 per cent as at June, below the 1.8 per cent threshold regarded as =
necessary for maintaining reasonable profitability for over two years.=20
=20
ICBC said that it =E2=80=9Cactively boosted consumption=E2=80=9D as such =
loans increased by 10.2 per cent in the period. Its net income fell 1.4 =
per cent from a year earlier to 168.1 billion yuan. Its net interest =
margin, a key gauge of profitability, narrowed to 1.3 per cent from 1.43 =
per cent.
=20
ICBC=E2=80=99s performance may spell trouble in turning earnings around =
for the full year, according to Francis Chan, a senior analyst at =
Bloomberg Intelligence. The bank has =E2=80=9Cvarious risks to revenue =
and limited room to reduce credit costs=E2=80=9D, he said in a note. =20
=20
Profit at rivals China Construction Bank and Bank of China fell 1.4 per =
cent and 0.9 per cent respectively, while net income at Agricultural =
Bank of China rose 2.7 per cent and Bank of Communications reported a =
1.6 per cent gain. They all reported a narrower margin from a year =
earlier, while bad loan ratios slid from the end of 2024.=20
=20
The combined profits of the country=E2=80=99s commercial banks shrank =
7.7 per cent from a year earlier to 1.2 trillion yuan in the first half, =
official data showed earlier this month. That marks the first decline =
since 2020, when the pandemic shut down factories and businesses.

While the authorities have guided banks to lower funding costs via a =
round of cuts in deposit rates, Bloomberg Economics sees more monetary =
easing as likely as China addresses its economic weakness, further =
sapping loan yields for lenders.=20

China=E2=80=99s aluminium factories are changing to escape a crushing =
price war
The Asian nation=E2=80=99s property boom is over, and has left behind =
small to medium-sized manufacturers saddled with overcapacity, =
evaporating margins and a relentless struggle for customers
[BEIJING] For Liang Zhu, who runs an aluminium factory about 100 =
kilometres north of Hong Kong, there is only one way out of =
China=E2=80=99s vicious spiral of excessive competition: shift away from =
inexpensive metal for window frames and door handles, and towards the =
specialised alternatives needed for iPads and airplanes.
=20
Guangdong province has long been a powerhouse of light manufacturing. =
Today, though, many companies such as Liang=E2=80=99s are battling to =
survive in the era of =E2=80=9Cinvolution=E2=80=9D, a term commonly used =
to describe the country=E2=80=99s intense, self-harming industrial race. =
China=E2=80=99s property boom is over, and has left behind small to =
medium-sized manufacturers saddled with overcapacity, evaporating =
margins and a relentless struggle for customers.
=20
=E2=80=9CWithout sufficient profits, there will be no funds to invest in =
innovation, research or in finding solutions for society,=E2=80=9D said =
Liang, general manager at Guangdong Mingzhu Metal Material Technology, a =
company he founded after returning from a spell working in Australia. =
=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s a dilemma for us, so we look for ways to get out =
of this so-called involution.=E2=80=9D
=20
Producers of aluminium to be used in railings or furniture thrived in =
Guangdong from the early reform years of the 1980s up until the =
country=E2=80=99s real estate crisis began in earnest five years ago. =
Since, the region has seen a wave of consolidation.
=20
In July, Mingzhu Metal started up its first production line making items =
with =E2=80=9C7-series=E2=80=9D aluminium, a more complex product =
that=E2=80=99s harder to rework and weld, more resistant to heat and =
easier to crack when cooling. Most importantly, it has lucrative buyers =
in China=E2=80=99s emerging higher-value industries =E2=80=93 from =
aerospace to electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer goods.
=20
Aluminium is arguably the world=E2=80=99s most versatile metal because =
it=E2=80=99s lightweight, durable and does not rust. Extruders, as =
companies such as Liang=E2=80=99s outfit are known, take thick bars of =
semi-finished metal and work it through several phases to form different =
shapes and profiles, from car frames to supports for solar panels.
=20
This corner of the sector has long relied on real estate and =
infrastructure, so the collapse of construction activity since the start =
of the pandemic has been devastating. Operating rates for aluminium =
processors are at about 60 to 70 per cent for the best-performing =
companies, and at only 40 to 50 per cent for the weaker ones, according =
to researcher Shanghai Metals Market, or SMM. Both are below the 80 per =
cent level deemed a healthy minimum.
=20
Midstream aluminium producers are =E2=80=9Cfacing complex situations =
such as weak domestic demand, increased uncertainty in foreign trade, =
and intensified internal competition in the industry=E2=80=9D, the China =
Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said in July. =E2=80=9CThe price =
competition situation is quite severe, and overall processing fees have =
reached a historic low.=E2=80=9D
=20
Shandong Nanshan Aluminum, a major producer of extrusions in eastern =
China, is a case in point. The firm said last week it will close 120,000 =
tonnes of its total 320,000 tonnes of capacity after recording =
utilisation rates of just 59 per cent. It plans to shift its focus to =
higher-end products for industry and autos.
=20
President Xi Jinping has said that he wants to =E2=80=9Cbreak =
involution=E2=80=9D, which means reducing the excessive competition and =
capacity levels blamed both for a cycle of domestic deflation and =
raising tensions with trade partners.
=20
The campaign is taking different forms across industries. Nationwide =
coal output declined in July from a year ago, after government =
inspectors targeted mines that produce too much. Oil refining and =
petrochemicals are set for a sweeping overhaul. And bosses from EV =
companies and some tech giants have been called before regulators and =
warned about over-competition.
=20
An hour=E2=80=99s drive from Mingzhu Metal is China=E2=80=99s =
=E2=80=9Caluminium capital=E2=80=9D of Foshan, known for its panoply of =
extruders, fabricators and wholesale markets. Here, Foshan Golden Source =
Precision Manufacturing has passed through several phases of =
specialisation and technological upgrades since it was founded in the =
early 1990s.
=20
Its showroom exhibits include trailer ramps and bathroom fittings to =
hard disc components and parts for the Harmony trains that pioneered =
China=E2=80=99s high-speed rail. The firm has hewn closely to the =
technological path prescribed by Xi=E2=80=99s Made in China 2025 plan =
that was launched a decade ago.
=20
Most recently, Golden Source has developed components for EV charging =
points and lightweight fittings for airplane trolleys. When general =
manager Rain Tam took over the business from her father, its founder, =
she raised spending on technological research in order to cut costs and =
to improve product quality.
=20
Even then, there is intense competition.
=20
=E2=80=9CTechnological innovation helps profit margins for some =
products, but overall our margins will be a lot worse this year than =
last,=E2=80=9D said Wang Shunli, deputy general manager. =E2=80=9CRight =
now, when it comes to pricing, I feel the pressure is extremely =
high.=E2=80=9D
=20
China=E2=80=99s last round of industrial supply reforms after 2015 =
heralded changes across the sector, from the smelters that produce =
aluminium to the factories that handle the metal. For extruders, strict =
new controls on carbon emissions and energy consumption put the squeeze =
on smaller, less efficient firms.
=20
That=E2=80=99s left an environment that is complex, but also modestly =
positive. Chinese demand for the metal is set to grow 3.4 per cent this =
year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. China Hongqiao Group, the =
biggest primary aluminium producer, gave an upbeat outlook after it =
reported a rise in first-half earnings.
=20
=E2=80=9COverall aluminium consumption is trending upward, but the main =
issues are rapid capacity expansion and severe product =
homogenisation,=E2=80=9D said SMM analyst Liu Xiaolei. =E2=80=9CThe =
aluminium industry is shifting towards new energy sectors, but these are =

Xpeng, smaller EV makers kick sales goals in China as BYD stalls
Other EV startups are making market share gains against the big players, =

[BEIJING] As BYD weathers a rough patch atop China=E2=80=99s market for =
new-energy vehicles, other, smaller players are surpassing their sales =
goals by leaning into demand for cheaper cars.
=20
Xpeng reported year-to-date deliveries of 271,615 units on Monday (Sep =
1), more than three times the same number of cars it sold in the first =
eight months of 2024. A key reason is the launch last August of its MONA =
M03 model, which starts from just 119,800 yuan (S$21,556).
=20
The entry-level electric vehicle (EV) competes with mass-market models =
from BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings but leverages Xpeng=E2=80=99s =
highly regarded intelligent technologies. It=E2=80=99s quickly become a =
bestseller, accounting for about 40 per cent of Xpeng=E2=80=99s monthly =
sales.
=20
That=E2=80=99s translating directly into financial improvements for =
Xpeng. The carmaker=E2=80=99s net loss narrowed in the second quarter =
while gross margins expanded to 17.3 per cent. During an earnings call =
last month, chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said that the EV maker expects =
monthly deliveries to consistently exceed 40,000 units starting in =
September.
=20
Xpeng is also set to receive a boost from its newly revamped P7 sedan, =
which launched last week. First introduced in 2020, the refresh should =
=E2=80=9Ckick off a product cycle acceleration=E2=80=9D, HSBC Holdings =
analysts led by Yuqian Ding wrote.
=20
Beyond its own product line, Xpeng is securing new revenue streams =
through strategic partnerships. On Aug 14, Xpeng and Volkswagen =
announced an expansion of their collaboration around electronic and =
electrical architecture for the German automaker=E2=80=99s combustion =
engine and plug-in hybrid platforms in China. The move is expected to =
bring in additional software service revenue with considerable margins.
=20
Other EV startups are making market share gains against the big players, =
too.

Zhejiang Leapmotor Technologies reported monthly deliveries of 57,066 =
vehicles in August, an increase of more than 88 per cent year on year, =
according to a post on the company=E2=80=99s official Weibo account. =
Consumers are rushing to showrooms to snap up its affordable models, =
such as the B10 and C10, which such as Xpeng=E2=80=99s EVs, are packed =
with intelligent features.

of the landmark diplomatic summits of his more than decade-long rule. It =
comes at a time of heightened global tensions as Donald Trump=E2=80=99s =
tariffs disrupt international trade flows and regional wars continue to =
flare.
=20
Without naming any country, Xi called on the group to =E2=80=9Coppose =
the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and bullying =
practices=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 a thinly-veiled reference to what Beijing =
sees as the US=E2=80=99s strong-arm tactics in the trade war.

Xi said the group should set up an SCO Development Bank =E2=80=9Cas soon =

states and expand educational opportunities, including doubling =
SCO-specific scholarships.
While the amounts pale in comparison with the US$50 billion financial =

ground. The summit offers Putin a chance to talk with Xi and Modi =
directly about the outcome of his meeting in Alaska with Trump and the =
prospect of reaching an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Samsung, SK Hynix sag after US revokes China chip gear permits
Non-Chinese companies only spent about US$2 billion on new gear for =
their factories in that country in 2024
[SEOUL] Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix shares slid on Monday (Sep 1) =
after the Trump administration decided to make it harder for the =
world=E2=80=99s largest memory chipmakers to ship critical equipment to =
their giant Chinese operations.
=20
The surprise ruling deals a potential blow to their production in the =
world=E2=80=99s largest semiconductor market. While both South Korean =
companies have memory plants in South Korea, China accounts for a major =
slice of their global output. Samsung sank more than 2 per cent, while =
SK Hynix stock was more than 4 per cent lower in morning trading.
=20
Samsung and Hynix compete with Micron Technology to make key components =
for most electronics from Apple iPhones to Nvidia AI servers. The pair =
had operated in China under regulations that allow them to import =
chipmaking equipment without applying for a new license each time. They =
now have 120 days until the waiver expires, according to an announcement =
in the US Federal Register. Companies can seek licenses to continue =
operations.
=20
The Trump administration=E2=80=99s move would revise what=E2=80=99s =
known as the validated end user, or VEU, rules, handicapping the ability =
to make chips in the country and jeopardising Beijing=E2=80=99s access =
to certain technologies.=20
=20
Those waivers date back to 2023 when then-president Joe Biden=E2=80=99s =
administration moved to allow the South Korean chipmakers to acquire the =
equipment they need to sustain and expand their giant operations in =
China. Washington effectively granted an indefinite waiver on broader =
restrictions banning the shipment of advanced chipmaking gear to the =
country.=20
=20
SK Hynix said on Friday that it would =E2=80=9Cmaintain close =
communication with both South Korean and the US governments and take =
necessary measures to minimise the impact on our business=E2=80=9D. =
Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe Trump administration is committed to closing export control =
loopholes =E2=80=93 particularly those that put US companies at a =
competitive disadvantage,=E2=80=9D Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey =
Kessler, who oversees export control programmes, said. =
=E2=80=9CToday=E2=80=99s decision is an important step towards =
fulfilling this commitment.=E2=80=9D
=20
The US decision emerged days after US President Donald Trump met his =
South Korean counterpart, President Lee Jae Myung, at the White House. =
In their meeting, the two men discussed a recently sealed agreement that =
set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15 per cent, sparing the country =
from the 25 per cent that Trump had threatened.=20
=20
The removal of the waiver will have a small impact on the market for =
semiconductor machinery, according to research from Bernstein. =
Non-Chinese companies only spent about US$2 billion on new gear for =
their factories in that country in 2024, accounting for less than 2 per =
cent of total industry sales on equipment last year.
=20
Plants in China owned by overseas companies do have an outsized =
influence on memory chip supply, though. They account for 10 per cent of =
computer memory output and 15 per cent of storage chips, according to =
the report. BLOOMBERG

Japan eyes record spending requests on rising debt, social welfare costs
=20
[TOKYO] Japan=E2=80=99s government spending requests for next fiscal =
year will likely set a record for the third consecutive year, a draft of =
the requests obtained by Reuters showed on Monday, highlighting the =
challenge the country faces in fixing its dire finances.
=20
The expected rise in spending comes on top of calls for tax cuts by =
opposition parties, which Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba=E2=80=99s =
minority coalition must heed to pass next year=E2=80=99s budget through =
parliament.
=20
Under next fiscal year=E2=80=99s budget, government agencies will =
request a combined 122.45 trillion yen (S$1.07 trillion) in spending, =
the draft of the requests showed.
=20
The biggest outlay would come from the health ministry, which requested =
34.8 trillion yen in spending mostly to pay for rising social welfare =
costs for an ageing population.
=20
A record 32.4 trillion yen would be requested for servicing =
Japan=E2=80=99s huge debt, as the central bank=E2=80=99s interest rate =
hikes and rising bond yields push up the cost of borrowing.
=20
Requests for defence spending are also set to rise to a record 8.8 =
trillion yen, the draft showed.
=20
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will scrutinise the requests to finalise =
the government=E2=80=99s fiscal 2026 draft budget by the end of this =
year, which will then be submitted to parliament for deliberation.
=20
Bond yields have risen recently as investors focus on how =
Ishiba=E2=80=99s fragile political standing could affect Japan=E2=80=99s =
efforts to rein in a debt pile which, at twice the size of its economy, =
is the biggest among its major peers.
=20
Known as a fiscal hawk, Ishiba has faced calls from within his party to =
step down to take responsibility for a stinging upper house election =
loss in July.
=20
Ishiba=E2=80=99s administration will face its biggest test when his =
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will decide on Sep 8 whether to =

Mizuho plans more dealmaking to become top Asia investment bank
[TOKYO] Mizuho Financial Group is aiming to become Asia=E2=80=99s top =
investment bank by bolstering equity underwriting and M&A advisory, =
seeking to replicate the headways the firm has made in the US.
=20
Japan=E2=80=99s third-largest financial group plans to deepen ties =
between its banking and securities units in Asia and Europe in order to =
boost revenues, Yutaka Nanjo, head of global investment banking at =
Mizuho Securities, said. In the US, Mizuho wants to further leapfrog =
rivals to rank regularly in the top 10 for investment banking, Nanjo =
said.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CIn the US, we built our own platform ahead of competitors and =
are leading Japanese securities firms,=E2=80=9D said Nanjo, who sees UBS =
Group and BNP Paribas as competitors. =E2=80=9CWe must strengthen Europe =
and Asia, which are outside our core strength in the Americas.=E2=80=9D
=20
Mizuho and its domestic rivals have long sought expansion overseas, =
undertaking acquisitions to drive growth. With deals in Japan now also =
reviving under a slew of corporate governance changes, banks are busy =
trying to find talent to pounce on the opportunities.=20
=20
In the US, Mizuho bought a portfolio of North American loans from the =
Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 2015 to build its client base. More =
recently in 2023, the firm acquired US boutique advisory firm Greenhill =
& Co to forge deeper into investment banking.=20
=20
Mizuho ranks 14th in the US for fee income from debt and equity capital =
markets as well as M&A advisory, for the fiscal year ended March, =
according to its investor relations presentation.
=20
While this trails Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase, it is far =
ahead of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group=E2=80=99s 20th position, =
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group=E2=80=99s 29th place and Nomura =
Holdings=E2=80=99 41st ranking, the presentation shows. The US business =
is profitable and a =E2=80=9Cmajor pillar=E2=80=9D within investment =
banking, Nanjo said. =20
=20
In Europe, Mizuho is ranked 27th, while in the Asia Pacific, the firm is =
number three behind first-placed Nomura, according to the presentation.=20
=20
To reach its ambition to be the top dealmaker in Asia within the next =
decade, Mizuho plans to intensify efforts to groom bankers who can do =
both commercial and investment banking, Nanjo said. It will also hire =
talent from outside the firm, he said, declining to elaborate on =
numbers. Its current Asia-Pacific head of banking Joris Dierckx is a BNP =
Paribas veteran who joined last October.=20
=20
Nanjo also said that the firm is open to having a role in hostile =
corporate takeovers in Japan, where the taboo of being a financial =
adviser in these situations still lingers despite such M&As becoming =
more common.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not a simple decision,=E2=80=9D Nanjo said, adding =

consolidation in about a decade and a half after the nation=E2=80=99s =

the biggest lenders to combine to survive in a tough market and get rid =
of their mountains of bad debt.
=20
The high-pressure mergers and acquisitions often led banks to keep the =

Seoul moves ahead with 1st K-pop venue, opening set for 2027

SEOUL =E2=80=93 South Korea=E2=80=99s Seoul Arena is set to open in the =
first half of 2027 to address Seoul=E2=80=99s lack of a large concert =
hall dedicated to musical events as the city=E2=80=99s first =
K-pop=E2=80=93centered cultural venue, the Seoul Metropolitan Government =
said on Sept 1.
=20
Currently under construction in Dobong-gu, north-eastern Seoul, Seoul =
Arena is slated to become the capital city=E2=80=99s first concert hall =
capable of hosting over 20,000 spectators, with the city government =
seeking to fill a large gap in performance infrastructure.
=20
Despite its reputation as the hub of K-pop, Seoul has long been under =
criticism for its lack of music venues dedicated to concerts with more =
than 10,000 seats.
=20
Due to this lack of infrastructure, concerts are often held in sports =
stadiums.
=20
For artists needing larger venues, shows are pushed to the outskirts of =
the capital in Incheon and Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.
=20
Seoul Arena is expected to span from two basement levels to six floors =
above ground, featuring two performance venues. Its main arena will hold =
up to 28,000 visitors, while its mid-sized hall will fit up to 7,000 =
people.
=20
The city government added that Seoul Arena=E2=80=99s musical venues will =
also be equipped with advanced acoustic systems, flexible staging and =
optimised sightlines for audiences, addressing long-standing issues at =
existing facilities where poor acoustics, obstructed views and stage =
restrictions have been frequent complaints.
=20
In addition to its performance venues, other cultural facilities =
=E2=80=93 such as shopping venues and a cinema =E2=80=93 will be located =
inside the arena.
=20
The city government also sees Seoul Arena as a driver for regional =
revitalisation.
=20
=E2=80=9CAs north-eastern Seoul was previously a culturally underserved =
area, (Seoul Arena) could transform it into a hub for culture and =
tourism, while also stimulating the local economy in nearby =
north-eastern Gyeonggi Province, symbolising balanced regional =
development,=E2=80=9D said the city government through its press =
release.
=20
The venue will also be located near Changdong Station on Seoul Subway =
Line numbers 1 and 4, and Nowon Station on Line numbers 4 and 7.
=20
Once the upcoming GTX-C express line finishes construction nearby, the =
site will also be accessible within 20 minutes of central Seoul and =
Gangnam, and within an hour from Incheon Airport.

On Sept 1, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon visited Seoul Arena=E2=80=99s =
construction site to inspect its progress and safety management.

=E2=80=9CIn a year and a half, Seoul Arena will stand as a world-class =

=E2=80=9CThrough the provision of world-class performance infrastructure =

Airbus faces sprint to hit target after about 60 deliveries in August
Deliveries are the company=E2=80=99s main near-term industrial target
=20
[PARIS] Airbus needs to deliver planes at a record pace to reach its =
annual target after delivering about 60 aircraft in August, industry =
sources and analysts said on Monday (Sept 1).
=20
The world=E2=80=99s largest planemaker is aiming for a 7 per cent =
increase in deliveries to 820 jets this year, but has been hit by delays =
in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Deliveries are the =
company=E2=80=99s main near-term industrial target and determine revenue =
and cash generation, as well as affect airline growth plans.
=20
If confirmed, a tally of about 60 aircraft in August would mark a sharp =
increase from the same month in 2024 but still leave cumulative 2025 =
deliveries about 3 per cent behind the same point last year, at about =
433 jets, analysts said.
=20
Airbus declined to comment ahead of the publication of monthly data =
early on Friday. In July, the planemaker reaffirmed its annual target of =
=E2=80=9Caround 820=E2=80=9C deliveries, up from 766 in 2024. Airbus has =
been in a tug of war with engine maker CFM as airlines clamour for spare =
engines in competition with assembly lines for new aircraft. It said in =
July that it also faced engine delays from Pratt & Whitney.
=20
Airbus has been producing aircraft without engines in anticipation of a =
surge of engine arrivals in the second half of the year and reported 60 =
of what are called =E2=80=9Cgliders=E2=80=9D in the system when posting =
mid-year results.
=20
It has said that once engines arrive, it needs one to two months to =
convert a semi-complete airframe into an airliner ready for delivery. =
That will put pressure on Airbus to whittle down a significant part of =
the deficit in the third quarter.
=E2=80=9CI still feel it=E2=80=99s doable ... but September is going to =
be the real test,=E2=80=9D Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said.
=20
Veteran industry watcher Rob Morris, ex-head of consultancy at Cirium =
Ascend, warned Airbus would have to outdo even the record performance =
seen before the pandemic, which inflicted damage on suppliers that has =
yet to be fully repaired.
=20
Based on Cirium=E2=80=99s estimate of 58 deliveries in August, he said =
Airbus would need to deliver an average of 97 aircraft a month between =
September and December to hit its full-year goal.
=20
That would need to be 5 per cent better than the previous highest =
average for that period of 92 aircraft in 2018 or 91 in 2019.
=20
Using statistical methods based on past performance, there is a 5 per =
cent chance that Airbus will get to 810 deliveries this year, Morris =
said.
=20
=E2=80=9CMy own personal view is that they will achieve around =
790-800,=E2=80=9D he added. Airbus deliveries were briefly eclipsed by =
Boeing during a slow start to the year, but the European company is on =
course to remain the world=E2=80=99s largest planemaker this year as its =
rival=E2=80=99s activity recovers gradually from internal crises. =

The recent F1: The Movie starring Brad Pitt has further broadened the =
sport=E2=80=99s appeal.

coaster market conditions for US air travel that complicate the =
prospects for a long-term recovery.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe general criticism of the first bankruptcy is that Spirit =
wasn=E2=80=99t aggressive enough in cost-cutting and only using the =
filing to address debt to some extent (perhaps not enough even =
then),=E2=80=9D Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in an e-mail. =
=E2=80=9CSpirit has been making many adjustments already since last =
fall. However, further cuts appear likely.=E2=80=9D
=20
The bankruptcy, filed late on Friday (Aug 29) in New York, lists assets =
and liabilities of between US$1 billion and US$10 billion. The petition =
comes amid active negotiations with some of its largest lessors, secured =
noteholders and key stakeholders, the carrier said.
=20
Spirit=E2=80=99s petition underscores the difficulty facing discount =
airlines in the US, from high labour costs to the ever-present struggle =
to grow enough to protect margins.=20
=20
Much larger and more diversified carriers such as United Airlines =
Holdings and Delta Air Lines are adding to the pressure, selling =
=E2=80=9Cbasic economy=E2=80=9D fares to lure cost-sensitive passengers =
away from cheaper options at Spirit and rivals such as Allegiant Travel, =
Frontier Group Holdings and even Southwest Airlines.=20
=20
Southwest is fighting back with an extensive makeover plan, offering =
premium fares with more legroom and assigned seats =E2=80=93 breaking =
away from the one-size-fits-all business model it championed for five =
decades. Spirit and Frontier also have adjusted their business models to =
include upscale options.
=20
Market turbulence=20
It=E2=80=99s unclear how dramatic an overhaul Spirit could pursue.=20
=20
Ultra-low-cost carriers are hit harder when there=E2=80=99s too much =
capacity on routes, forcing them to cut fares at the expense of profits. =
Unlike the industry=E2=80=99s leaders, Spirit lacks long-haul =
international routes that can make up for weakened demand in the =
domestic market.
=20
Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, while the US airline =
industry was in the midst of a sharp decline in flying by consumers =
concerned with US President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s trade war and rising =
inflation.=20
=20
Flying has bounced back, but the whipsaw market conditions, including a =
new trend of late bookings, has undermined carriers=E2=80=99 ability to =
forecast demand.=20
=20
There=E2=80=99s still a lot of uncertainty about what carriers will be =
able to charge for tickets, given airline capacity plans are still being =
adjusted for the crucial holiday travel period, analysts say. An =
oversupply could gut fares, heaping extra pressure on lower cost =
carriers more so than larger operators.
=20
Aircraft glut
If history is any guide, Spirit=E2=80=99s board will have more than =
market forces to worry about.=20
=20
Part of Spirit=E2=80=99s challenge will be how to downsize its fleet as =
it works to cut costs. It=E2=80=99s expected to encounter tough =
negotiations with lessors, which supply the bulk of Spirit=E2=80=99s =
fleet. In bankruptcy, some airlines have been allowed to return planes =
on lease, though it=E2=80=99s unclear whether Spirit will be able to win =
approval to pursue that path.
=20
=E2=80=9CWith the current board and management, we expect a more =
aggressive review of costs and negotiation with partners, most notably =
lessors,=E2=80=9D Syth said.
=20
In a filing, Spirit said that it received a written notice of default on =
Aug 25 from aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings, which said it was =
terminating dozens of leases on aircraft that were scheduled for =
delivery to Spirit in the coming years.
=20
Termination would cost Spirit more than US$2 million per lease and apply =
to dozens of aircraft, the filing said. Spirit disputed the notion of a =
default and said that the termination of leases was invalid.
=20
As of Jun 30, Spirit had 215 Airbus A320-family aircraft, including 148 =
financed under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and =
2043. It owns 49 planes and has 18 under finance leases.
=20
Spirit may try to return as many as 150 leased planes, Jefferies analyst =
Sheila Kahyaoglu said. Less than 50 per cent are likely to return to the =
domestic market, she said, because most carriers already have sufficient =
capacity to meet demand.
=20
=E2=80=9CThis bankruptcy will be harder and look different than last =
year,=E2=80=9D leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA at =
Spirit told members on Friday. The airline will likely offer more =
extended voluntary leaves to employees, the union said. Previously =
announced pilot furloughs and downgrades will take effect in October and =
November.
=20
Takeover target
Airlines operating in Chapter 11 can be particularly vulnerable as =
takeover targets, and the proceedings could make Spirit more susceptible =
to a suitor.
=20
The carrier=E2=80=99s filing comes a day after Bloomberg reported that =
Spirit engaged rival Frontier Group Holdings in high-level talks about =
the carrier=E2=80=99s ongoing efforts to chart a path forward. Frontier =
and Bill Franke, the Frontier chairman, have pushed for years for a =
combination of the two lower-cost carriers. =20
=20
America West Airlines merged with bankrupt US Airways Group in 2005. The =
combined company, operating under the US Airways name, acquired American =
Airlines parent AMR in 2013 to bring that carrier out of bankruptcy.
=20
Spirit was bruised by a 2022 takeover battle between JetBlue Airways and =
Frontier. Spirit eventually agreed to be acquired by JetBlue in a US$3.8 =
billion deal, but the combination was blocked in January 2024 by a =
federal judge on antitrust grounds. BLOOMBERG

Wealthy Americans pour record sums into private credit funds
The inflows point to the growing importance that major private =
investment groups are now placing on individuals, even as inflows from =
large institutions slow down
=20
PRIVATE credit funds are drawing in record sums of capital from everyday =
investors, offsetting a slowdown from large institutions as wealthy =
individuals are lured in by the higher returns on offer.
=20
Affluent individual investors in the US have pumped US$48 billion into =
private credit funds in the first half of this year, already surpassing =
the entire haul in 2023 and on pace to eclipse 2024=E2=80=99s high-water =
mark of US$83.4 billion, investment bank RA Stanger has said.
=20
European investors are also diving in, with assets in so-called =
evergreen private debt funds across the continent, more than doubling =
from a year ago to 24 billion euros (S$36.1 billion) at the end of June, =
said consulting firm Novantigo.
=20
The inflows underscore the growing importance that major private =
investment groups are now placing on individuals; analysts at rating =
agency Moody=E2=80=99s are calling it =E2=80=9Cone of the biggest new =
growth frontiers in the industry=E2=80=9D.
=20
It also represents just the tip of the spear for groups that had lobbied =
heavily to open the broader US retirement market up to private equity =
and credit. Their push culminated in US President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s =
executive order in August that paved the way for their broader inclusion =
in 401k plans.
=20
Brad Marshall, Blackstone=E2=80=99s head of private credit, said: =
=E2=80=9CThe growth is coming from a very under-penetrated market. =
Private markets offer investors a premium (over) what they can get in =
public markets.=E2=80=9D
=20
Fundraising in traditional drawdown, private credit funds has slowed =
alongside a broader downturn for the leveraged buyout industry, which =
has struggled to return capital to investors in the years since the =
Covid-19 pandemic and has, in turn, suffered weaker inflows.
=20
Data from Preqin shows that private credit vehicles pitched to large =
investors, including endowments and pensions, have raised successively =
less every year since hitting a peak in 2021.
=20
New contributions from wealthy individuals, by contrast, have =
accelerated. They have been spread across a handful of different =
vehicles, complicating comparisons between firms.=20
=20
The Stanger data focuses on non-traded business development companies as =
well as interval funds, which offer redemptions at set periods. =
Collectively, they are known as evergreen funds, because they do not =
wind down on a specific date in the future. Investors can also =
continuously put more money in.
=20
Flows into the vehicles were stable during market swings earlier this =
year, after US President Donald Trump launched his tariff blitz against =
most of the US=E2=80=99 largest trading partners. That has bolstered =
confidence that demand from individuals is durable, and that smaller =
investors will not race to redeem at the first sign of turbulence.
=20
John Sweeney, who runs wealth solutions at Brookfield, said: =E2=80=9CIt =
reinforced what we=E2=80=99d want to see =E2=80=93 people not running =
from alternatives, but looking at alternatives and saying there was =
stability there.=E2=80=9D =20
=20
Blackstone has long dominated the market, although it is facing =
intensifying competition from rivals such as Apollo Global Management, =
Blue Owl, Ares Management and BlackRock=E2=80=99s HPS Investment =
Partners.
=20
Blackstone=E2=80=99s private credit fund, known as Bcred, has drawn in =
US$6.5 billion so far this year, and US$11.7 billion over the past 12 =
months. On the average day markets are open, individual investors are =
placing more than US$50 million of orders for the fund, the Stanger data =
shows, putting it at the top of the pack.
=20
Those inflows, supercharged by leverage, have pushed the size of Bcred =
up more than 50 per cent in the past two years, to US$73 billion in =
June.
=20
Others are catching up. Apollo=E2=80=99s offering, Apollo Debt =
Solutions, has raised US$6.4 billion over the past year, and two large =
funds from Blue Owl have taken in roughly US$7 billion. Ares=E2=80=99 =
main offering for wealthy individuals, the Ares Strategic Income Fund, =
has raised US$5 billion.
=20
A smaller investment management firm, Cliffwater, has won massive share =
among independent wealth managers. Its fund has gone toe-to-toe with =
Blackstone, raising nearly US$11 billion in the past year, and now =
stands at more than US$30 billion.
=20
Blackstone was earlier than many of its rivals as it charged into wealth =
management offices, pitching major players such as Morgan Stanley and =
UBS, as well as the independent advisers that direct how millions of =
Americans save for retirement.
=20
That resulted in near total market share for its product among other =
business development companies (BDCs) that are not publicly traded, =
sitting just below 90 per cent in 2021, noted Stanger. While it has =
remained the top draw for wealth managers, that figure has fallen to 28 =
per cent among similar vehicles amid a wave of new fund launches.
=20
Raj Dhanda, global head of wealth management at Ares, said wealth =
managers were keen to expand the number of funds they could pitch =
clients, given that Blackstone=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cshare of the market =
was probably uncomfortably high=E2=80=9D.
=20
But he noted that it was still a small set of asset managers drawing in =
investors. =E2=80=9CAfter a small group of the leading global =
alternative managers, the flows fall off considerably,=E2=80=9D he said.
=20
European private markets are also seeing a surge of interest from =
individual investors, sparking a wave of new fund launches across the =
continent. Novantigo counts 37 private credit evergreen funds in the =
market, up from just six in 2022. Ares and Blackstone have both been =
fundraising, and HPS is launching its own vehicle, according to a =
filing.
=20
Private credit itself has moved into the mainstream after post-crisis =
regulations limited lending by the traditional banking system. Major =
asset managers stepped into that void, lending directly to businesses =
and consumers.
=20
The rapid pace of inflows has caused consternation from some inside the =
industry, even as their management fees swell. The inflows have =
materialised alongside a broad market rally, which has led to stiff =
competition among investors in private and bank syndicated loans. That =
has weighed on returns, as private lenders compete aggressively to win =
deals.
=20
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s a tricky investment environment, driven by the =

Chanel owners lean on 38 year-old heir to protect their billions

power over one of the world=E2=80=99s biggest multi-generational =
fortunes.
=20
Deep family connections? Check. Ivy League degree? Check. Wall Street =
smarts? Check.

Now there are growing signs the scion from the dynasty behind the Chanel =
empire is moving closer to the top of the firm overseeing its US$90 =
billion fortune.=20
=20
Heilbronn, 38, has taken on management positions overseeing his and his =
relatives=E2=80=99 real estate, banking and media investments in the six =
years since joining Mousse Partners, one of the world=E2=80=99s largest =
and most discreet family offices. In the latest indication of ascent for =
the Harvard Business School graduate and ex-Goldman Sachs banker, he =
became a director earlier this year for one of Mousse=E2=80=99s main =
holding entities, occupying a role vacated following the death of =
longtime Chanel executive Michael Rena, according to registry filings.
=20
He is also the son of Charles Heilbronn, founder of Mousse and the =
firm=E2=80=99s chairman since 1991. Charles is a half brother of Alain =
and Gerard Wertheimer, third-generation heirs to the Chanel fortune.
=20
The Wertheimers are grandsons of one of the original business partners =
of Gabrielle =E2=80=9CCoco=E2=80=9D Chanel who started the fashion house =
in 1910. They shared the same mother as Charles, Eliane Heilbronn, who =
was considered the empire=E2=80=99s matriarch until she died last year. =
Her sons are all in their 70s.=20
=20
A representative for Mousse declined to comment.=20
=20
The Wertheimers, credited with owning equal shares of closely-held =
Chanel, each have a net worth of about US$45 billion, according to the =
Bloomberg billionaires Index. Their fortune has largely held up in the =
post-pandemic era, even as a downturn in luxury goods hit rivals =
including LVMH, led by Bernard Arnault, and Kering, controlled by the =
Pinault family.=20
=20
Arthur Heilbronn=E2=80=99s rise gives some indication of the succession =
plans of the media-shy extended family, which has long sought to keep =
its wealth out of the public eye. Gerard Wertheimer=E2=80=99s son David =
has started a private equity venture, though there=E2=80=99s no =
indication that other children of the two heirs are involved with =
Mousse.
=20
=E2=80=9CThey feel less like a family office and more like a private =
endowment for a luxury empire,=E2=80=9D Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, =
an advisory firm for family offices, said of Mousse. Among its peers, =

At least one-fifth of individuals among the world=E2=80=99s 500 biggest =
fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totalling =
more than US$4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg billionaires Index.
=20
A recent survey of 317 family office clients at UBS Group found just =
over half of them have a succession plan in place, with those in the US =
and South-east Asia most likely to have made those arrangements.

Heilbronn joined Mousse as a director in 2019, moving to managing =
director a few years later, according to his LinkedIn profile. =
He=E2=80=99s currently co-head of private equity and venture direct =

its most high-profile investments to date by joining two other French =
dynasties in 2023 to help take the bank private.=20
=20
Chanel=E2=80=99s ultimate holding company is the Wertheimers=E2=80=99 =
Cayman Islands-based Mousse Investments, which doesn=E2=80=99t reveal =
financial numbers. Mousse Partners is the investment division and also =
has offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.
=20
Mousse Investments describes itself as having a =E2=80=9Cbroad range of =
asset classes in public and private markets=E2=80=9D in addition to =
Chanel. While Mousse doesn=E2=80=99t disclose how much money it =
controls, some companies have named Mousse Partners as a participant in =
deals or as a shareholder. That points to investments in stocks, real =
estate, credit and private equity.
=20
Mousse Partners employs more than three dozen people worldwide and =
counts former banking analysts from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo among =
its employees. Suzi Kwon Cohen joined as chief investment officer almost =
a decade ago after leading North America private equity for =
Singapore=E2=80=99s sovereign wealth fund GIC, putting her among the top =
female executives in the historically male-dominated family office =
space.
=20
Over the years, Mousse Partners has backed a wide range of startups =
including mental health provider Brightside Health, digital advertising =
firm Brandtech Group, biotechnology company Evolved by Nature, food =
company Harmless Harvest and health-care provider Thirty Madison. Last =
year Mousse joined the billionaire L=E2=80=99Oreal heiress investing in =
high-end clothing brand The Row.    =20

Not all bets have proved lucrative. Beautycounter failed last year while =
a pair of Mousse=E2=80=99s public holdings are languishing. The family =
office has a roughly 8 per cent stake in listed French digital =
entertainment company NetGem and 5.7 per cent in hair products maker =

Mousse has also been invested for decades in France=E2=80=99s publishing =
and audiovisual industry through Media-Participations, which owns a =

businesses.=20
=20
The family behind Chanel, a maker of US$970 sunglasses, US$6,500 =
handbags and US$23,400 J12 watches, has joined other French luxury =
billionaires with media holdings at home. Bernard Arnault owns =
newspapers Les Echos and Le Parisien along with the glossy weekly Paris =
Match. The Pinault clan owns magazines Le Point and Point de Vue.=20
=20
While Mousse is not involved in Chanel=E2=80=99s operations, both =
companies have offices in a glass tower just south of Central Park in =
Manhattan that=E2=80=99s famed for its pricey rents and list of major =

Drill, baby, drill: Has Big Oil learnt anything from Deepwater Horizon?
The legacy of history=E2=80=99s largest marine spill is back in focus as =
the industry prepares to go even deeper
=20
THIS month 15 years ago, the US government declared the Deepwater =
Horizon oil well sealed, ending a catastrophic leak that spilled 4.9 =
million barrels (779 million litres, or 311 Olympic-sized pools=E2=80=99 =
worth) of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
=20
The disaster =E2=80=93 which killed 11 people =E2=80=93 was the largest =
marine oil spill in history, unleashing an environmental crisis that by =
some estimates harmed hundreds of thousands of marine animals and =
devastated coastal ecosystems.=20
=20
Now, as of September 2025, that legacy is being fiercely debated as the =
oil industry prepares to drill even deeper.
=20
Why is BP returning to the Gulf?
Despite the controversy, BP is ramping up its commercial ambition in the =
Gulf of Mexico again.=20
=20
The company is developing Project Kaskida, a new deep-water well located =
250 miles (402 km) from New Orleans, due to start production in 2029.=20
=20
When completed, Kaskida may produce 80,000 barrels of oil per day, with =
potential to access up to 10 billion barrels over its lifetime. It will =
be the Gulf=E2=80=99s first major oil field since the Deepwater Horizon. =

=20
The project will require drilling deeper than the well that failed in =
2010 =E2=80=93 nearly 1,798 m to the bottom of the Gulf, then another =
9,906 m in the rock.=20
=20
This move is part of a bigger story: in the years since the Deepwater =
Horizon spill, the US became the world=E2=80=99s top producer of crude =
oil in 2018, a mantle the country has held every year since.
=20
What drives the industry=E2=80=99s high risk appetite?
The continued corporate focus on deep-water drilling highlights that the =
risk appetite of major oil firms remains high. This is driven by two key =
factors.=20
=20
First, these locations have long proven a rewarding frontier ground for =
oil exploration, with governments generally permitting firms to operate =
there.=20
=20
In the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, the US government awarded the first =
new post-disaster deep-water drilling permit in March 2011, less than a =
year after the Deepwater Horizon spill began.
=20
Second, the world=E2=80=99s oil giants are highly resilient to =
wide-ranging international risks.=20
=20
Their scale and profitability, despite fluctuations in oil prices, equip =
them to absorb major setbacks and respond quickly to new opportunities. =
Even after incurring tens of billions of dollars in costs and seeing its =
share price nearly halve in 2010, BP remains a dominant industry player.
=20
What are the main safety and political concerns?
The legacy of Deepwater Horizon, however, is much broader than the fate =
of one company.
=20
The disaster received massive global attention, with an almost immediate =
regulatory and political backlash. Soon after the oil spill began, =
several countries including the US, Canada and Norway declared =
moratoriums on deep-water drilling.
=20
A decade and a half on, significant concerns continue to be voiced about =
the safety of deep-water drilling. Several Democratic members of the US =
Congress have written in collective opposition to the Kaskida project, =
calling it =E2=80=9Can unacceptable threat to Gulf communities, =
ecosystems, and the climate=E2=80=9D.
=20
The legislators highlight BP=E2=80=99s own estimate that a worst-case =
scenario at Kaskida could release up to four million barrels =E2=80=93 =
=E2=80=9Ca disaster on par with, or exceeding, the Deepwater Horizon =
spill=E2=80=9D. They also claim that BP =E2=80=9Cseverely underestimates =
the potential size and duration of a worst-case discharge=E2=80=9D.
=20
This political concern is amplified by many non-governmental =
organisations too. Jackson Chiappinelli of Earthjustice, an =
environmental organisation opposed to the new BP project, asserts that =
=E2=80=9Cthe deeper you go into the ocean to drill, the greater the risk =
of a spill=E2=80=9D.
=20
What are the long-term environmental and human costs?
Evidence from other major spills indicates there can be long-term legacy =
on local ecosystems. A number of species still reportedly have not fully =
recovered from the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which spilled about 41.6 =
million litres of oil.
=20
The University of South Florida asserts that multiple fish species have =
not fully recovered since Deepwater Horizon. The US National Wildlife =
Federation claims that the impact on wildlife is broader, noting that =
local dolphin populations, struggling with worsened lung disease and =
other health issues, could take decades to rebound.
=20
The human cost is also still being measured.=20
=20
Research from the US National Institute of Health on more than 30,000 =
workers in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill clean-up found they had an =
increased propensity for health problems including heart attacks, =
diabetes, rashes, and other skin conditions.
=20
So what=E2=80=99s next?
In this context, the pro-industry =E2=80=9Cdrill, baby, drill=E2=80=9D =
mantra of the second Trump administration raises broad concerns.=20
=20
The first is that while scientific and technological innovation can =
improve safety, completely risk-free drilling is unrealistic, given the =
remote and challenging nature of the work.=20
=20
The second concern is that intense international focus on the Deepwater =
Horizon disaster and earlier ones such as Exxon Valdez can obscure a =
more chronic problem.=20
=20
Significant spills occur regularly around the world with far less =
attention. A 2006 report concluded that Nigeria=E2=80=99s Niger Delta =
has experienced the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez leak every year for =
nearly 50 years.
=20
It may have been 15 years since the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the =
controversy continues. In the absence of further major disasters in the =
near to mid-term future, deep-water drilling will likely remain a key =
part of the landscape for years to come.

Trump=E2=80=99s World Liberty token falls in first day of trading
=20
NEW YORK - The digital tokens backing the Trump family=E2=80=99s =
cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, fell in value on Sept 1 =
in their first day of trading.
=20
The World Liberty tokens, known as $WLFI, were sold to investors after =
the Trump family and its business partners in 2024 launched the venture, =
a decentralised finance platform that has also issued a stablecoin.
=20
Investors in the tokens voted in July to make them tradable, paving the =
way for their sale and purchase - and potentially boosting the value of =
the president=E2=80=99s holdings of them.
=20
Early investors can sell up to 20 per cent of their holdings, World =
Liberty has said.
=20
The tokens initially traded above US$0.30 (S$0.39) in their Sept 1 debut =
but later fell in price. They were down about 12 per cent at US$0.246 as =
of 6.40pm GMT (2.40am on Sept 2 in Singapore), according to CoinGecko =
data.
=20
That gave the token a total market capitalisation of just below US$7 =
billion, making WLFI the 31st largest crypto token in circulation, =
CoinGecko data showed.
=20
Several of the world=E2=80=99s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, =
including Binance, OKX and Bybit, are offering the tokens on their =
platforms.
=20
Since World Liberty=E2=80=99s launch in 2024, the Trump family has made =
around US$500 million from the project, according to Reuters =
calculations based on the company=E2=80=99s terms and conditions, =
transactions traced by crypto analysis firms, and publicly disclosed =
deals.
=20
The tokens were not made tradable at their initial sale. Instead, they =
gave holders the right to vote on some changes to the business, such as =
its underlying code. Early investors have said the primary draw of $WLFI =
was the connection to Mr Trump and their expectations that the tokens =
would grow in value due to his backing.
=20
Making the tokens tradable allows investors to determine their price, =
enabling speculation, earning trading fees for exchanges that list them, =
and likely stoking interest from a wider swath of crypto investors.
=20
World Liberty and Mr Trump=E2=80=99s other crypto businesses have faced =
criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts who =
say the Trump family=E2=80=99s forays into the cryptocurrency =
businesses, at the same time as the president reshapes the regulatory =
framework that governs digital currencies, represent profound conflicts =
of interest.
=20
The White House has said repeatedly that Mr Trump=E2=80=99s assets are =
in a trust managed by his children and that there are no conflicts of =
interest. REUTERS
