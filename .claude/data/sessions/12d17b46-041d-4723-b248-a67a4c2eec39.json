    "how can we use the serena mcp server? Whatever we type here, will it reflect on the serena logs web?",
    "you said that actions we take with serena tools will be logged by the mcp server, which means it will be reflected on the serena web log? What about other normal actions (not with serena tools), will they get logged by serena web log too?",
    "can we try exploring the codebase with serena?",
    "what are the key modules in this ICE project directory?",
    "in terms of modules related to data ingestion, how many apis, mcp servers do we have?",
    "what are the key modules in this ICE AI solution? Think hard.",
    "in terms of this developement workflow, what are the core files?",
    "where is ice main notebook ipnb?",
    "ice_main_notebook.ipynb should be archived. \n\nWe have @dual_notebooks_designs_to_do.md , @ice_building_workflow_design.md , @ice_building_workflow.ipynb , @ice_query_workflow_design.md and @ice_query_workflow.ipynb. These are for creating the ice building and querying workflow notebooks, they will serve as the main notebooks of our ICE AI Solution, for the purpose of helping with the development of our ICE Ai Solution. They should demonstrate, visualize, and allow me to interact with the key modules in the two workflows. These notebooks should faithfully demonstrate the workflows without any bruteforce or forced prints that may cover up any gaps, inefficiencies or errors. They should be clean, robust and prioritise simplicity. then allow users to observe the outputs of the key modules and to interact with the key modules.\n\nWithout implementing any changes for now, focus on checking this files mentioned to see if deliver what i have mentioned. ultrathink.",

    "yes we shouldremove fallback to let failures be visible. For the purpose of portfolio holdings, we can use a toy dataset.\n\nWhat are the missing sections from the implementation?\n\nYes we should add proper visualisation of graph structure.\n\nFor any changes, you have to be mindful of which workflows are the changes for, building or querying workflows? These two workflows should be conceptuall and logically aligned and coherent. Dig through our notes on lightrag to double check on the implementation of these two workflows. \n\nWe do not need to include business workflows, but the business workflow should be in your mind when you develop or plan the ICE AI solution, along side the notebooks regarding the two workflows.\n\nRegarding enahnced interactivity with parameter control and drill-down capabilities, lets skip this for now.\n\nYes the notebooks should show actual system outputs rather than expected / demo responses. We should be able to test out on any tickers within our universe scope. For the portfolio holdings, we can use our toy dataset.\n\nUltrathink. Then, do not implement any changes first, we want to focus on planning for now. \n\nCreate a clear to-do list that i can add iinto @ICE_DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md , but first, check the @ICE_DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md to see if there are any to-dos on the developmeent of these two notebooks.

    "i dont want to implement this now, should we store this somewhere? Is @dual_notebooks_designs_to_do.md the correct place to store this? if yes, edit it appropriately to reflect this. Then for @dual_notebooks_designs_to_do.md , is it supposed to be linked to @ice_building_workflow_design.md and @ice_query_workflow_design.md? Ultrathink.",
    "are you still using serena?",
    "use sererna to analyse the architecutre more systematically, understand the relationships between the different modules. Then list out the key modules in this project directory. We want to find the key modules that we want to focus on. Find the key modules that are aligned with the two workflows (building and querying workflows. Take your time. Ultrathink. Do not implement any changes for now, we want to analyse the project directory and the key modules that we have so far."
